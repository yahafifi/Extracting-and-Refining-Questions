        "text": "'the goat life' a masterpiece I only got to watch last night. (No spoilers) It tells the REAL story of an indian migrant worker who goes to Saudi Arabia to earn money to send back home, but finds himself living a slave-like existence herding goats in the middle of the desert. \nThe movie puts the light on the modern day slavery which is pretty much thriving in KSA and other golf countries. The movie is very well filmed with some amazing scenery from the Jordan and Algerian desert but man, was it a hard watch! \nApparently KSA and Qatar have it banned and lots of people claim that it offends Islam though I didn't think that myself while watching it. There's some memes online joking that it took KSA millions of dollars on PR to improve their reputation but it took one Indian movie to expose their system/dominating culture of what it really is: racist, corrupt and inhuman. 10/10 for me, highly recommend watching it.

                "body": "It is the same in Dubai, how do you think those sky scrapers were built. The workers there used to live 10 at a time in containers, usually sleeping on to of one another. Most were from Pak/Ind/SL and BD and almost all of them had their passports taken the moment they arrived which is \"legally\" not allowed. Again almost all of them had fallen victims to local agents in their respective countries who promised them streets paved with Gold (which was kind of true but not foe them), they sold all the meagre property they had, like little land that they had for generations, the little gold the women preserved for generations etc.\n\nThe moment they arrived, their Kafeel (sponsor)took away their documents and they were packed like sardines in a container, whisked off to work before dawn every day because it was a bit cooler and then worked outside in 45 degree heat all day and then sometimes double shifted at night also if they were able to remain standing. They were paid a pittance of 500-600 Dhs which was around 200 dollars from which they used to send almost all the money back home apart from a  couple of months where they used to buy a phone calling card for 40 Dhs that allowed them to talk to their families for a few minutes. Later came internet cafe calls through Yahoo (which were legally banned and didn't allow any free calling services because there was only one government owned telecommunications company \"Etisalat\" that had monopoly and didn't want to lose money from the free VoIP services. Whatsapp calls etc are all still banned. They did start a new company called Du when the international community said that a monopoly isn't allowed but its mostly owned by the government through shell companies anyway.\n\nAnyway the workers got so depressed that many of them started jumping of the pedestrian bridges above Sheikh Zayed road because there is a concept of Diyat (blood money) in the UAE so the unfortunate person who was blissfully unaware and was just driving on the highway suddenly hits a worker who fell from above and was now forced to pay the sum which is around 200k Dhs or around 60-70k USD which was money the workers wouldn't have earned there in 10 lifetimes, so to secure their families a better future and to end this miserable existence most of them started jumping of the bridges. And if the workers were unlucky enough to die due to the extreme heat, or some building falling et then their family got almost nothing and it was a race against time then. \n\n  \nAnyway this has gotten real long so I will just finish by saying, international human rights agencies intervened and told the UAE that if they want to  be taken seriously as a 1st world country then they should take human rights seriously, a few watchdogs were set up which has helped the workers cause a bit but its still really bad compared to the West. You can just google it and see how many workers die there monthly but those numbers are maybe just 30-40% of the original as all the local newspapers are also government owned or regulated so whatever is printed is whatever they want you to know."

So thanks for the reminder.\n\nI'm not shocked at all that it is banned and caused outrage. The money has gotten into these bedouin people, they don't like being reminded of their true origins and receiving very valid criticism. Without oil a lot of these people wouldn't be living so different than the workers they treat as below them. I know.\n\nI think another aspect of it might be the caste system which makes people more likely to end up exploited or used to mistreatment. However this kafala system is not limited to Indian or South Asian workers.\n\nI don't see it ending any time soon tbh. Its more complex than (Gulf) Arabs just being racist and shitty."

I remember it was less common in the late 90s and we were poorer ourselves back then but 00's onwards you can easily find a maid in your average household.\n\nI agree people are very lazy and they've delegated very basic tasks to underpaid foreigners who they can all treat like shit without any repercussions. When I think about old stories of how people used to mistreat and extremely abuse their own family during my grandfather's and parents' generations I'm not so shocked that they're fine treating workers this way.\n\nOver the years I've challenged my family over this and so did my siblings but they call us westernized and joke that we're making a big deal about nothing. The most I've succeeded to change after all this time is make them understand they have to speak more respectfully and not yell at people just because they are poor migrants. But they still justify taking the passport because \"we'll always give it back once they ask and say when they plan to leave so what's the issue\".\n\nIf you say anything they act like you're the one with the problem. But from the maids perspective even in these \"friendly\" households there is fear of conflict and the uncomfortable questions about whether they intend to come back and then the horror stories they hear from other maids in shitty households. A person shouldn't have to do anything for their own passport. It is so disgusting, and a child doesn't deserve to be born into this mess and have to feel involved against their will. I am just glad its not as bad as many of the households I know.\n\nIt won't end any time soon and its harder to protest against when your parents get older and you have to leave your country. The best we can do is treat them good, pay them better, tell others around us to be nicer and limit their tasks to essentials like cooking lunch and so on.\n\nWe're not America, there won't be a movement to stop it and these people probably have to face worse fates in their homelands so they gamble by going to the Gulf and hope they get a decent enough family. Like if I went back and told our old maid this is exploitation and no one should ever take your passport she would just look at me like I'm crazy and freak out and worry I might cause her problems."

There are many similar motifs in many of the surrounding cultures as well. On the other hand, Exodus and the Epic of Gilgamesh have far less in common, besides both having a main character: one king trying to achieve immortality, the other prince looking for his identity and freeing his people. \n\nIn other words, the epic of Gilgamesh bears some similarities to the biblical flood narrative in Genesis but is not really related to the Exodus story."

                "body": "You have had a rough time with your living experiences. I am sympathetic with your plight and homelessness can affect you mentally. In continuing to research your situation I went to the r/homeless Reddit forum. Most there are persons form the U.S. experiencing homeless. The majority of it there experience homelessness because of a mixture of substance addiction or rental rates are high in the U.S. right now. A certain percentage experience homelessness it from domestic issues like emotional abuse from family or a in a smaller number there is physical abuse. \n\nFor your situation I would take a que from these r/homeless forum. I talked with you on another post, but I will reply to this one. The trends I saw in posts in that forum were that people showed sadness and sometimes depression about their living circumstances. You have voiced you feel like that now. By the start of week two of a homelessness situation posters talk about looking their survival instinct kicks in an an adaptive response occurs to look for jobs. Obviously under two different economic systems comparing the U.S. and Cuba there are going to be some important differences, but there are enough similar properties to survival regardless of homelessness happening in the U.S or Cuba to give you a few points to help survival. You specified your general location and I worked with that in some online searches. \n\nTemporary employment and day labor agencies were a repeated theme on the r/homeless forum on what helped people earn some money and then have enough to find a room in a house to rent or an apartment with roommates. My online search states the names of  temporary agencies nearest you are Selecmar, Atrio, Acorec, and UBSA. A Cuban website called CubaTrabajos may list some paid jobs. Also listed is a taxi service called Cubataxi S.A. As Miramar is located within the Havana metropolitan area that certainly helps to locate resort work. I am wondering if being part of the cleaning crews that clears out rooms from guests would be an option. This is certainly what happens sometimes in the U.S. with both legal and illegal workers \"earning money under the table\" i.e. earning through cash payments after cleaning motel or hotel rooms. \n\nThings are difficult in Cuba as a whole and certainly social services support can be variable, but being located where you are right now has the greatest advantage anywhere inside Cuba right now. I mentioned that Cuba's way of doing social services is via the Ministry of Labor and Social Security. In Havana that government office has an online address listing of Calle 23 e/ O y P. Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n. La Habana. Cuba.  The main office of the INASS that is for Cuba's social insurance is at Calle 1ra No. 160, e/ 4 y 6, Vedado, Havana, Cuba. Please talk to the local church bishop and church personnel you have contact with to help you get in contact with the INASS to see what can be done to offer you direct help.\n\nOn a side note from the Reddit r/homelwss forum please follow this advice. Look out for your footwear whether resting or sleeping. Keep your phone next to your body at all times. It is one of the most valuable things you have. Do not let anyone touch it. Stuff your shoes into your shorts or the top band of your shorts or pants. They are the most likely things to get stolen from you while sleeping even if you sleep outside. Make sure to hide your phone into your shirt or pants waistband as well so it is not easy for someone to steal them without waking you up."

You need to help us help you by getting us information we can use. Do you have apple pay? I don\u2019t think I can transfer from the US due to embargo, but someone here will send you a fiver for a hot meal\u2026 And a hot meal goes a long way for morale when it seems like hope is gone.\n\nChurches are going to be your best friend right now, most will give shelter. I don\u2019t know what church culture is like in Cuba, so you may want to just stick with a story of you getting kicked out because of apostasy. And to be honest, I don\u2019t think it would be immoral or unethical for you to express interest in Christianity, even if it isn\u2019t true. No need to lie, just say you\u2019d like to find out more since Islam has failed you.\n\nAnother option, trying a psych institution since you\u2019re suicidal and it could potentially get you a roof, some food, and maybe a social worker or doctor who can refer you to a shelter.\n\nDon\u2019t forget: drink water from wherever you can get clean water, I got some from a church hose one time when I was in dire need. When you eat, try to savor it and take it slow, because you don\u2019t want to throw up.\n\nHope to hear from you soon!"

Therefore, my answer will be different from yours because it is from my religious perspective. I advised him to repent to Allah and think about the matter, because if he wants to remain an atheist, then he should forget about his family and manage his own affairs. I cannot give advice if he is determined to remain an atheist, then there is no solution to his problem."

                "body": "1. ~~People already knew the Dead Sea was the lowest region on Earth before Islam.~~ It appears I misspoke. It was known that the Dead Sea was a lower point at the time of Muhammad, but it wasn't confirmed that it was the lowest point until around the 19th century. However, the Quran didn't know this either. Muslims make this claim from verses 30:1-3, and if you look at the meaning of it, you'll see the Quran didn't specifically mention that the Dead Sea is the lowest point on Earth. So this is another example of Muslims misinterpreting the Quran to make it seem like it stated a scientific miracle.\n2. This was proposed by Thales of MIletus, who lived before Muhammad.\n3. It doesn't. This is a deviation from what the Quran actually says in 51:47. What it's really saying is the heavens are being expanded, not the universe. Definitely not the same thing.\n4. That's not even what the Big Bang theory states...\n5. Tbh I don't know this one, hopefully someone can chime in here.\n6. ~~I think it would be common knowledge that the ocean had waves. After all, this is something that could've easily been observed.~~  It appears I actually misread what the image said for this one. However, the Quran still didn't express any scientific miracle here. The poster is referring to [this verse](https://quran.com/24/40?translations=101,19,84,85,20,22,21,18,17,95), and there is no prediction of waves at the bottom of the ocean here. All it's saying is that waves at the surface level have bigger waves preceding them in some instances. This is something that could've easily been observed. \n7. This is a scientific mistake. Even if oceans don't appear to be mixing, they are still partially doing so.\n8. Another scientific mistake. Mountains do not resemble pegs on Earth in any way. They are created by colliding tectonic plates.\n9. What about all the other prophecies Islam got wrong?\n10. The embryology mentioned in the Quran is a rehash of Galen's theory, which has been proven to be scientifically false.\n11. This verse does not say that lies are formed in the front of the brain. Muslims love to deviate from what the Quran is actually saying to make it look like it predicted a scientific phenomenon. [This](https://quran.com/en/al-alaq/16) is the verse, and what it's really saying is that liars will be grabbed by their sinful forehead. No indication of lies being formed in the frontal cortex is made in this verse. If Allah wanted to put a scientific miracle here, why wouldn't he just articulate it clearly?\n12. Yes. As you can see, all the miracles here were either known at the time, could've easily been observed, were straight up false, or isn't what the Quran actually said.\n\nLet me know if you need me to debunk anything else."

Also, maritime trade, sea travel and underwater pearl harvesting was practiced for thousands of years before Muhammad in the Arabian peninsula and there is no way Arabs already didn't know anything about the darkness and waves underwater before Muhammad! Also, that verse describes darkness in ocean as an \"analogy\" which clearly implies Arabs already knew about the darkness in ocean. You only analogize an idea to something that your audience is already familiar with, otherwise the analogy fails and serves absolutely no purpose!!!\n\nAll these \"miracles\" are just clever play on words and the sequence of words within a verse, bending of grammar rules, sly modifications of translations and crafty manipulations of meanings of words to fit into a particular well-known scientific theory or fact!"

So much so that they ended up using it more than kings. It literally was a head of state and religious status. \n\nAlso just gotta do it  for the boys and gals on this sub who actually left Islam. His major contradiction here is that the Quran says the Bible is to be trusted or at least Jesus's word if I'm not mistaken (correct me if I'm wrong friends I'm still only on my second read through of the Quran as i am a Christian but dont like to speak on things without an education on it) and if that's the case then it already contradicts his point of correcting the Bible. Which wasn't incorrect in the first place about the title of Pharoah."

In many verses you'll find that the Qur'an says that it is only confirming the previous scriptures Torah and Gospel.\n\nIn fact the Qur'an even goes on to say that Jews and Christians should follow their scriptures. Why does Allah ask to follow those books that have been corrupted? (This also hints that Islam in early stages was a form of non trinitarian Christian sect). \n\nA web of lies (in hadiths) were knit later to incorporate hate against people of the book by claiming that your books have been corrupted and that the Qur'an presents the final correct form.\n\nSome verses for reference below:\n\nSurah Ali 'Imran 3:3\nHe has revealed this Book to you, setting forth the truth and confirming the earlier Books, and earlier He revealed the Torah and Gospel\n\nSurah Ali 'Imran 3:48\nAnd He will teach him the Book, the Wisdom, the Torah, the Gospel,\n\nSurah Al-Ma'idah 5:47\nLet the followers of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed therein, and those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are the transgressors.\n\nSurah Al-Ma'idah 5:66\nHad the People of the Book observed the Torah and the Gospel, and all that had been revealed to them from their Lord, sustenance would have been showered over them from above and risen from beneath their feet. Some among them certainly keep to the right path; but many of them do things which are evil.\n\nSurah Al-Ma'idah 5:68\nSay to them: 'People of the Book! You have no solid ground to stand on unless you establish the Torah and the Gospel and all that had been revealed to you from your Lord. Indeed the message revealed to you from your Lord will aggravate insurgence and unbelief in many of them. So do not grieve for those who disbelieve."

Shit even their most famous buildings like the Hagia Sophia are literally Christian temples converted to Islamic buildings. \n\nSpain was ruled by Islam for 700 years. Until the Reconquista\n\nThen you have the battle of Vienna, where if not for Poland and other allies the Ottomans (Muslims) would have almost certainly conquered most of Europe. \n\nIt's conveniently instead taught that Christians were just mean brutal evil dudes determined to conquer and slaughter. \n\nPretty much all of the shut taught these days is so anti Christian it's insane...\n\nBig bang theory? Invented by a catholic priest... most of modern (western)  science owes itself to the church. Hence why most of the world uses the Gregorian calendar to track time. It's the most accurate to date. Made by the church. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on colonialism and it's massively misinterpreted cross with Christianity. \n\nThen the most misinterpreted of them all.... the Spanish inquisition.

                "body": "Hello friend I appreciate the response and will do my best for you! Okay so yes firstly his name was Georges Lema\u00eetre. He was ironically a catholic priest lol. \n\nSo firstly I just want you to know there are people out there and I won't point fingers because as a Christian to be hated is normal I mean it's what we consider our Victory (see Jesus and how much hate he gets and what happened to him and how we use this as our symbol of love and redemption) \n\nSo for example if you go to the Britannica website for Georges Lema\u00eetre this for example is his description. \n\n\"Georges Lema\u00eetre (born July 17, 1894, Charleroi, Belgium\u2014died June 20, 1966, Leuven) was a Belgian astronomer and cosmologist who formulated the modern big-bang theory, which holds that the universe began in a cataclysmic explosion of a small, primeval \u201csuper-atom.\u201d \"\"\n\nNotice they conveniently left out his other religious background. It is all over brother.  \n\nSo for example you know Issac Newton I'm sure? Gravity and the apple story haha. Well for example did you know he dedicated his whole life and learning to understanding God and His works in creating our universe.  \n\nI'll just give a few quotes from him if you don't mind. \n\n\"I have a fundamental belief in the Bible as the Word of God, written by those who were inspired. I study the Bible daily.\" \n\n\"God is the same God, always and everywhere. He is omnipresent not virtually only, but also substantially, for virtue cannot subsist without substance.\"\n\nHe was a man of science but a man of God. They go hand in hand as you will see. \n\nFor Galileo it's actually kind of funny, but the best way to shorten it and make it easy to understand is this \nHe couldn't get the community to change what the church (who was very interested in science and astronomy) had already established publicly as how the universe worked. He was if you will a radical to many amd although he didn't do anything except challenge their ideas, it was when he literally used the Pope's own words against him publicly amd pretty much insulted him. Even though the church was very much his biggest supporter ironically. Well during the time it was the inquisition and it got him a LOT of heat. I've heard the phrase Galileo was his own worst enemy haha. He kind of stubbornly made himself get a lot of heat and attention is the best way to put it. You can look up way better explanations In detail that make my version look dumb haha. \n\nSo I don't wanna make you read an essay but yes please take some time to do personal digging on this subject. \n\nThere is a video here from this gentleman who does a fee videos explaining the misconceptions behind Christianity and it does include a moment about science as well.  \nhttps://youtu.be/ULPH9yKj9DE?si=buk9EWVpsiEbfEo_\n\nHe also has one explaining how the crusades are justified (they very much were) and how the inquisition is NOTHING  like you hear about in pop culture today. \n\nI hope I helped a little with your question friend and I hope you have a great day and your loved ones are doing great \ud83d\ude0a God bless you."

Christianity was in no way against science and promoted it and it's push to where it is today. Hence why most of the world uses the Gregorian calendar for example the most accurate tracking of our planets and cycles. Made by the church. \n\nChristians wanted to understand how God made the universe. Like Issac Newton wanting to learn about gravity and whatnot but still was only doing so to understand  \"God's creation\". \n\nThe inquisition was not necessarily a great thing. But it also depends where you mean. For example Spanish inquisition had a lot to deal with. They were ruled by Muslims for over 700 years through conquest and spent hundreds of years getting them and anyone fighting against a unified nation out. The inquisition lasted over 300 years and did not kill nearly as many as people claim. If you executed the person on trial that was considered a failure as they didn't repent or convert. These were extreme cases. Especially being it lasted hundreds of years. \n\nThe Catholic church meaning the Vatican I assume you mean? Well frankly many of us don't really recognize them much anymore being they are so hypocritical. However there is no claim of celibacy only until marriage. \nAnd I am Christian but am very much against church and state. A Christian does not force another to be Christian. These are people over hyping it to use the Bible as their excuse to do despicable acts. \n\nThe duties of a Christian are to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, love one another as a neighbor and protect the weak and helpless. Generosity, Courage and love are the 3 core values. Also forgiveness, acceptance and understanding. The Vatican is today and in the past at points a group using the faith of Christians to do as they wish. They are nothing like a true Christian in my belief especially since the most important part of the religion is your individual relationship with God and the acceptance of your sins and shortcomings. You are expected to discipline yourself to be better but also realize you are human and so are others and that we are all going to and have sin. \n\nAlways happy to discuss Christianity and theology with a friend mate. Hope you and your loved ones are well and you are having a great day!"

Even making him wash dishes would usually incur the wrath of the mother in law because how dare the woman, who's supposed to do all the housework, make her baby boy do any chores.  Incel is a pretty apt descriptor for these type of people, not just men, who feel like men should be in charge and women are nothing more than incubators and slaves."

After Muhammad dies, [she leads a war against Ali in Basra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Camel)\n\nSo Aisha was quite the leader, going to war and such. The hijab and niqab were how the wives of the Prophet did traditionally dress, but to wear hijab and niqab is not explicitly directed by the prophet anywhere I could find\n\nAlso, people are commanded thru Muhammad to [ask his wives for things from behind a screen](https://quran.com/33/53). With the screens, it would actually be quite easy to have a stand-in just answer questions of Muslims on their behalf. With the hijab and niqab they could actually out and about, and no one would really know where they are most of the time."

You refused to answer a question about a point you raised yourself and instead wrote a series of comments refusing to answer, and then repeatedly described that refusal as \u201cmatching energy\u201d which comes across as attitude to anyone else. \n\nI think you likely misunderstood their intentions and interpreted the question to mean they were saying your experience was less valid because you were not in the same type of covering as the people in the picture. And yet you\u2019re still just writing comments about how you don\u2019t think you should answer. I mean ok, you don\u2019t have to answer, but it\u2019s really strange to keep commenting about how you won\u2019t answer and energy instead of just saying what it was like playing basketball."

Muslim countries are very weak to invade progressive countries, but Muslims have other techniques to rule the world.. it can take centuries, but they have all the patience, they can gain sympathy for their causes, they ruin their homelands and immigrate to progressive countries and they have a very high birth rate..

There has been a longstanding conflict between Azerbaijan (a predominantly Muslim country) and Armenia (a predominantly Christian country) over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. This conflict has led to significant violence and casualties on both sides. The region is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but it has been controlled by ethnic Armenians for many years.\n\nRecent tensions have escalated, particularly after Azerbaijan regained control of parts of the region following a war in 2020. In September 2023, Azerbaijan launched a military offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh, leading to further casualties and a mass exodus of Armenians from the region. This has drawn international concern and condemnation, with many fearing for the safety of the Armenian population in the area. And Turkish Mooselimbs are the Ottomans taking their time to reload the next caliphate. Don\u2019t ever snooze on the people of this war religion. Evil is evil. There is always some atrocity against Christians in Turkey."

Whichever liar told you the name Keith Moore rather than the entire rest of the field of biology and embryology did you a great disservice. Did they tell you he was literally being paid by the Saudi government at the time? Did they tell you other people made those additions? Did they tell you Keith refused to address or ever defend those claims after leaving that job? Of course they didn\u2019t. They wanted you dumb and ignorant of the scope. They took a small useless data point that supported them and ran with it despite the issues. A common theme you will find. \n\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=N4trHH6AuZ0\n\nHere is a great video quick debate by an actual expert walking you through how the Quran is wrong.

The definition of mental backflips. \n\nInstead the [Quran just says bees exist and eat fruit](https://quran.com/en/an-nahl/68-69). WOW! How could someone know bees exist back then!!! \n\nSo where does this bullshit claim of predicting female worker bee come from?  The entire claim is based on the idea that Muhammad\u2019s use of a feminine noun and feminine verbs is intentional and for the purposes of letting us know that bees are female. However, the word for \u201cbee\u201d in Arabic is \u201c\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0651\u062d\u0644\u0629\u201d, or \u201cnahla\u201d, and is inherently feminine. The fact that Muhammad used a feminine word, when no other word was available, is extremely weak evidence that he wanted to tell us that worker bees are female. If Muhammad wanted to tell us that worker bees are female, why not just explicitly say, \u201cWorker bees are female\u201d ([Source](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/The_Miracle_of_Honey))\n\nIf I found another book using a female form of the word for bee even earlier than the Quran would that be evidence that religion is the true religion and Islam is false? Spoiler: I can do that. So be careful confirming this counts as good evidence for a religion or else you will have to change your religion again. But if it isn\u2019t good evidence for a different religion, then it isn\u2019t rational evidence for your religion. Which means\u2026\n\nAgain, I didn\u2019t make you pick this as your best evidence. This was just the best you had and were given. Pretty pathetic isn\u2019t it? Why is everything your imam or scholars told you so vague, false, and incorrect? Why does it look exactly like someone grasping at straws? How should that affect our confidence in Islam and those guiding you?"

The second monotheistic god is of the Zoroastrianism faith which also had a massive influence on them (as they also introduced concepts like dualism (good vs bad), angels and the afterlife influencing apocalyptic literature).\n\nFurthermore as someone else commented here the Caanites had a massive influence on the Isrealites aswell (El, altars, sacrifices and festivals). \nStories like the flood come straight from Gilgamesh, creation from Enuma Elish (Mesopotamia) and the code of Hammurabi is used as source for legal principles in the Thora like in the book of Exodus. Even the Hittites as some legal provisions have parallels with Hittite law. Then you have the Babylonians influencing concept like eschatology. \n\nLast you say the greeks invented logic. You really think before the Greek there was no logic. The Greeks did play a crucial role in the development of Formal Logic, but they did not invent the concept of reasoning or logical thinking. Human have always used forms of logical reasoning in various cultures long before the Greeks formalized it."

                "body": "It\u2019s kind of interesting. I mentioned that the Zoroastrianism introduced dualism which means good vs evil. They had a supreme being called Ahura Mazda representing order and good and opposing that they have the concept of the devil called Ahura Mainyu which was a evil entity who represents chaos and evil. The difference is they don\u2019t see Mainyu as divine or godly but he wasn\u2019t created by Mazda either. The evil spirit arose out his own free will is how they described it. And Mazda is considered eternal and uncreated. It was two parts of a comic struggle. Destruction vs creation, chaos vs order, evil vs good. But you clearly see what parts influenced abrahamic religions. \n\nThe concepts of Mazda being uncreated and eternal and then having a created (difference is here out of his own free will in abrahamic religions created by god) evil entity that opposes him. Duality."

                "body": "It's fascinating how religion, culture and language have evolved in tandem with one another over time. The names of several ancient Semitic deities were integrated into Semitic languages and became general terms to refer to a range of things including deities, after the advent of Abrahamic religions.\n\n\"El\" was the name of chief God of the ancient Canaanites and Levantine. Now it is just short for \"Eloha\" in Hebrew which literally translates to a general term which is \"God\" (singular). The word \"Eloha\" however isn't used in conversation in Hebrew, \"Elohim\" (plural) is preferred instead since that is usually how \"God\" is usually referred to in the old testament despite being a singular entity. It's kinda like how the writer(s) of Quran keep using \"we\" instead of \"I\" to refer to Allah in first person."

Even though everything is written about whats going to happen etc, the two angels kiraman and kaatibeen write down our good and bad actions after we carry them out, and on Qiyamat we will be held accountable based on the things which were written down by the two angels, when we will receive our book of deeds and not judge or accounted for based on what was written in the lawhe mahfuz. This shows that the judgement on qiyamat is just and you'll be accountable because of your free will. Question arises, what is the need of two angels writing things down if everything is already written? Simply put:\n\n1. Its a witness either for us or against us\n2. No real objections can be made as our whole life was documented while we lived and after we carried our actions etc. Meaning its a proof for or against us.\n\nAnother angle I look at this from is if I went into the future and watched you do your thing and wrote it down. I had no influence on the decisions you made, I just knew you'd do it because I saw it. That's God's view."

William Lane Craig has been corrected errors on his pet cosmological argument, yet he refuses to change it. Winger has made dozens of bad claims which Paulogia corrected. Just recently watched him make the same bad claims which is either pants on head stupid or much more likely lying for god. Lee Strobel is perhaps my least favorite as he knows his claims are bullshit and he keeps making them. Frank Turek as well. If you know what to watch for you will se he uses rhetorical tricks to make his points seem sound and dodges questions when his bullshit is pointed out. He knows he is lying. Gary Habermas has been corrected by Bart Erhman, but I don\u2019t think he is malicious, not a nice guy, but not malicious. I am pretty sure Gary is just delusional at this point from digging too deep, too long and trying to live up to his absurd claims. Possibly Gary\u2019s memory is just fading as it doesn\u2019t seem to have the intentionality of the others. I am not even going to critique the more bottom of the barrel apologists. \n\nThe only one that has any integrity is Sean McDowell, but I suspect he is trapped by his contract with the school he gets paid by. Sean seems like a seriously good dude and approaches things critically and with some humility and adjusts his responses and tries to give his interlocutors the benefit of the doubt."

That\u2019s the problem brother.\n\nFor example, we see in the sahih Hadith that Allah didn\u2019t just write that Adam would use his free will to sin. He DECREED that Adam would sin.\n\nSo it was Allah who said Adam should sin.\n\n\n\nSahih al-Bukhari 6614\nNarrated Abu Huraira:\nThe Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \u201cAdam and Moses argued with each other. Moses said to Adam. \u2018O Adam! You are our father who disappointed us and turned us out of Paradise.\u2019 Then Adam said to him, \u2018O Moses! Allah favored you with His talk (talked to you directly) and He wrote (the Torah) for you with His Own Hand. Do you blame me for action which Allah had written in my fate forty years before my creation?\u2019 So Adam confuted Moses, Adam confuted Moses,\u201d the Prophet (\ufdfa) added, repeating the Statement three times.\n\n\n\nYou can\u2019t say from the Hadith above that Allah just wrote what Adam would use his free will to do.\n\n\n\nLook at the Hadith below too, where Allah wrote a sin that it is INEVITABLE for you to do it.\n\n\nSahih Muslim 2658 a\nAbu Huraira reported Allah\u2019s Messenger (\ufdfa) as saying. Allah fixed the very portion of adultery which a man will indulge in. There would be NO escape from it. The adultery of the eye is the lustful look and the adultery of the ears is listening to voluptuous (song or talk) and the adultery of the tongue is licentious speech and the adultery of the hand is the lustful grip (embrace) and the adultery of the feet is to walk (to the place) where he intends to commit adultery and the heart yearns and desires which he may or may not put into effect.\n\n\n\nNow, if we go into the Quran, we also see same thing.\n\nWe can see from the verses below that it is Allah\u2019s will and actions that people disbelieve.\n\nIt\u2019s not their own free will. \n\n\n6:125\nWhoever Allah wills to guide, He opens their heart to Islam.1 But whoever He wills to leave astray, He makes their chest tight and constricted as if they were climbing up into the sky. This is how Allah dooms those who disbelieve.\n\n\nQuran 4:88\nDo you wish to guide those whom Allah has sent astray? And he whom Allah sends astray - never will you find for him a way [of guidance].\n\n\n\n7:188\nSahih International\nSay, \u201cI hold not for myself [the power of] benefit or harm, except what Allah has willed. And if I knew the unseen, I could have acquired much wealth, and no harm would have touched me. I am not except a warner and a bringer of good tidings to a people who believe.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAll these verses show that according to Islam, Allah has already willed for you to sin, willed for you to go astray, willed for you to disobey him.\n\nYou\u2019re just using your \u201cfree will\u201d to do what Allah has already \u201cWilled\u201d for you.\n\n\nSo if Allah \u201cwilled\u201d for you to obey him, then you\u2019ll use your \u201cfree will\u201d to obey him.\n\n\nThis is not freewill."

In order to protest against the government that tried to cover this up and not having strict enough laws to prevent this from happening again, a lot of Instagram templates are being shared. One of which is this. My first thought after coming across this was how familiar it is to the oppressive islamic rules. Trying to change females instead of the mentality of men. Do you think India is headed towards Islam like rules inspite of being a anti-muslim country? What do you think?",

This has been combined with improbable information about Asma being 100 years old at the time of her death in 73 AH to calculate that Aisha was eighteen or nineteen at the time of her marriage consummation (1 AH or 2 AH - (73 - 100) - 10).\n\n[Shaykh Haddad (link)](https://www.livingislam.org/ir/d/aam1_e.pdf) and the [IslamQA (link)](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/124483/how-old-was-aishah-when-she-married-the-prophet) website both independently criticise this approach as relying on a single narrator, who most scholars regard as weak, and note that a hadith by a more reliable chain from the same narrator gives a broader range for the age difference between the sisters. Both also note that al-Dhahabi too gave the vaguer opinion that Asma was \u201cten or more\u201d years older than Aisha."

I would give everything Islam to become like Christianity where it\u2019s only cultural for most people like in Europe and for it to not control all aspects of a state and culture. If her actions lead to that happening or at the very least make it easier for some Muslims to secularize then I\u2019m all for it. I can also see how she can be offended by people criticizing Islam and her being a tool to stop free speech. At that point you\u2019re criticizing her identity group and that will hurt you no matter how different yr values are to the rest of the group. But the fact of the matter is it\u2019s her personal choice. A lot of people will identify with a minority religion even if they don\u2019t believe in it just because of culture, identity, and inclusion. Secular Jews are a good example of this. Even if all Muslims stopped believing many of them would still observe Eid and Ramadan just because it\u2019s tradition. Also, most humans feel the need to believe in something bigger than themselves and atheism or agnosticism isn\u2019t enough for them. I would much rather it be a secular liberal Islam or Christianity than Wahhabism or fundamentalist baptism."

And that is a fallacy.\n\nIn the past and due to bad hygiene, malnutrition, the absence of medicines etc, there were evolutionary pressures that forced humans to mature biologically as young as 7-12 years old in order to avoid extinction, and due to the relative simplicity of the ancient societies, physical/biological maturation (menarche/adrenarche) matched psychosocial maturation so in the past who was physically mature was also psychosocially mature. So what is wrong in marrying who is physically/psychosocially mature according to the circumstances of his/her society??\n\nIn the present day and due to good hygiene, good nutrition, the presence of medicines etc, (menarche/adrenarche) still comes early as young as 7-12 years old, but due to the increasing complexity of present-day societies, physical maturation preceded psychosocial maturation so who is physically mature now is not psychosocially mature, and so it is wrong to marry girls as young as 7 or 9 or 11 years old now because they aren't psychosocially mature and that goes against the Islamic rule \"there should be no harming, nor reciprocating harm\".\n\nEvolution, development and the timing of puberty, Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006).\n\n",

No it was not evolution but a power move motivated by lust. \n\nIf a girl is forced to \u201cmature\u201d psychosocially, then it\u2019s for survival and that the society in which she resides in is not the most ideal nor perfect. It\u2019s medieval and not something that should be perpetuated in current times where there\u2019s modern medicine, education, technology, etc. \n\nSo if you are trying to justify for a self-proclaimed high moral prophet marrying a little girl\u2026 there is absolutely no excuse."

But Islamic apologists claim that puberty occurred earlier in the past, and thus it was ok for Muhammad to have sex with 9 years old \u2018Aisha.\n\nFirstly, please note that \u2018Aisha didn\u2019t get menarche when Muhammad had intercourse with her at the age of 9 years, but she was still prepubescent. There is absolutely no proof that she got her menses at the age of 9, but modern-day Muslims have fabricated this claim on their own. \n\nSahih Bukhari, Hadith 6130:\n\nNarrated `Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah\u2019s Messenger (\ufdfa) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for `Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)\n\nThe Quran (verse 65:4) allows men to have intercourse with prepubescent girls who have not reached puberty yet.\n\nSecondly, menarche does not mean that a girl has become able to have sex mentally and physically and have a child. There are girls who today get menarche at the age of 8 years or 7 years or 6 years or even at the age of 5 years. Does it mean it is ok to do sex with a 5 years old girl?"

With settle-ment, childhood disease and postnatal undernutritionbecame common [44,45] and therefore the average age of menarche was delayed. This matched the increasingcomplexity of society following the development of agriculture, settlement and population aggregation,which in turn led to the differentiation of social tasks and the creation of societal hierarchies. Roman lawassumed that females matured by the age of 12 [46]. As hygiene deteriorated with increasing population density,the age of menarche was delayed, particularly in Europe.However, once again, this delay was matched to the increased complexity of medieval society,and even more so in the industrial revolution from the 18th century. With modern hygiene, nutrition and medicine, these pathologi-cal constraints on puberty have been removed and the ageof menarche has fallen to its evolutionarily determinedrange. But now the complexity of society has increasedenormously and psychosocial maturation takes longer.\u201d (Page 10)\n\nRead your own source. Psychosocial maturity here isn\u2019t mental development but rather being capable of some degree of independence.\n\nWorst still however, Aisha wasn\u2019t a woman from the Palaeolithic ages, rather, she was a woman from the medieval ages who lived in an area with a much poorer agricultural productivity and suffered from chronic poor nutrition and low body weight until much later on in life and definitely after marriage and consummation, which according to your own source (see quote above and page 9 of the study) delays sexual maturation. She won\u2019t be at the bottom of the global average, she will be either in the middle or at the top.\n\nEven if we are to take the bottom end, it will still be quite a bit above 9 lunar years (8 years and 9 months in solar time), at around 12 solar years.\n\nShe won\u2019t be psychosocially mature either as if that matters. For the age of that is around 10-11 solar years."

                "body": "I've seen this article used before among Muslim apologists to 'contextualize' Aisha's age during her marriage and later consummation, without having read the actual article and realizing this article assumes a lot of psychosocial maturity, and even argues against the Aisha's young marriage as the 'norm' of the time. \n\n>In the past and due to bad hygiene, malnutrition, the absence of medicines etc, there were evolutionary pressures that forced humans to mature biologically as young as 7-12 years old in order to avoid extinction, and due to the relative simplicity of the ancient societies, physical/biological maturation (menarche/adrenarche) matched psychosocial maturation\n\nWhen you mention the 'past' of women maturing as young as 7-12 years old, the article mentions this age of menarche (not maturity) during the **Paleolithic times**, and not the seventh century during Mohammad's time. The article clearly states (and how the above graphic gets the ranges):\n\n>Although there are obvious limitations to interpretations obtained from skeletal remains, we estimate that menarche would have occurred between the ages of **7\u201313 years in Paleolithic times**...\n\n>...We propose that human females evolved to enter puberty at a relatively young age and **progressed to reproductive competence at 11\u201313 years of age**. This would have matched the degree of psychosocial maturation necessary to function as an adult in Paleolithic society based on small groups of hunter-gatherers.\n\nIn fact, even the proposed ranges are higher than Aisha's marriage (6 or 7 years old) and consummation (9 years old) during the **Paleolithic times**, which was a little more than 3 million years ago.\n\nWhat the article does say about the time period closer to the Prophet's lifetime:\n\n>This matched the increasing complexity of society following the development of agriculture, settlement and population aggregation, which in turn led to the differentiation of social tasks and the creation of societal hierarchies. Roman law assumed that females matured by **the age of 12**.\n\nThe article uses the evidence of Roman law to cite the psychosomatic maturity of women during that time, which was slightly higher than Paleolithic times due to the development of society. What would be a better indicator of the norms would be the Byzantine Empire during Mohammad's time, which had woman usually marrying at the age of [fourteen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_Byzantine_Empire). It was common for woman to get married nearing the end of their puberty and not at the start of menarche. \n\nThus, the article also argues the norms of psychosomatic maturity of women during the Prophet's time was still higher than the age which Aisha was married and even consummated. I wouldn't even say this article is not without huge flaws of assuming what psychosomatic maturity is and how it's measured in the past. But do not use it as justification for Aisha's age in marriage, as it's conclusion contradicts what Mohammad did was normal for the time. \n\nIronically, you should also read the actual article to 'contextualize' the graph before making sweeping generalizations."

Science says 25-30 is the age of least risk to mother and child for a first pregnancy:\n\nhttps://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5227 \n\n\u201cWith the onset of puberty, the female developmental trajectory diverges substantially from the childhood trajectory, whereas the male trajectory essentially continues its earlier course (Table S2). As a result, the female pelvis attains its obstetrically most favorable morphology around the age of 25\u201330 y, i.e., at the age of highest fertility\u201d\n\n2.. The younger the mother, the greater the risk. Childbearing in adolescents aged 12\u201315 years in low resource countries: a neglected issue. New estimates from demographic and household surveys in 42 countries:\n\nhttps://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x \n\n\u201cIt is frequently cited that girls who give birth aged 15\u201319 are more than twice as likely to die as those in their 20s (1, 2). However, this fails to capture the fact that risk increases with decreasing age. ......girls aged 15 or under had an odds ratio for maternal death four times higher than women aged 20\u201324. \u201c\n\n3. It is not just mortality, it\u2019s fistulas. Science says it is a problem:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/\n\n\u201cIn sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, obstetric fistula is very common, as access to and use of emergency obstetric care is limited ...... Several factors have been linked to the high occurrence of obstetric fistula in sub-Saharan Africa, including the preponderance of early marriage and teenage pregnancy, which in turn mean that the girls do not have pelvises which have sufficiently developed to allow reproduction [10]. This is further compounded by the poor nutritional status of most of the girls who live in these highly deprived settings [11,12].\u201d\n\n4. Aid workers confirm death and fistulas are the problems:\n\nhttps://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html\n\n\u201cThe greatest danger, however, is to the pelvic floor. Girls may start ovulating and menstruating as early as age 9, though the average is around 12 to 13. ........ Just because a girl can get pregnant, though, doesn\u2019t mean she can safely deliver a baby. The pelvis does not fully widen until the late teens, meaning that young girls may not be able to push the baby through the birth canal. The results are horrific, said Wall and Thomas, who have both worked in Africa treating women in the aftermath of such labors. Girls may labor for days; many die. Their babies often don\u2019t survive labor either.\n\nMany women and girls who manage to survive childbirth in these conditions may suffer from fistulas\u2014holes that develop between the vaginal wall and the rectum or bladder. When a baby\u2019s head becomes lodged during birth, it can damage the mother\u2019s soft tissue between its skull and her pelvic bones, causing portions of the tissue to die and creating a hole. Consequently, faeces and urine leak through the opening and out of the vagina. Such a condition leads to societal rejection and divorce for affected women, and young girls face an even greater risk."

Can you confirm that \"all\" girls in that era weren't mature at that age? No you cannot so it is still possible that Aisha was physically mature and indeed the historical evidence says that Aisha was physically mature, and the majority of Islamic scholars agreed that the prophet married her after physical puberty (ovulation/secondary sexual characteristics+the ability to have safe penerative sex) that is why he waited 3 years after the marriage contract.

Now think that through a bit. A 6 year old girl being hit on by a 50 year old man.\n\n\n2) He married her as soon as she had her first period. Again, think about this from a biological, social, and psychological perspective. What example is this setting for women? They are sex machines the moment they have their period? This young girl was wiping cum stains off his clothes. Would you revere stories of kings in that age for marrying girls after their first period and glamorizing their \"love\" for each other? Would you call this behavior perfect?\n\n\n3) His actions set the rules for all times and places. Because of his actions, kids are getting married off at ridiculously and frighteningly young ages till today. So, clearly he/God didn't see this, nor did he set any rule to prevent this. As a result, little girls are suffering and dying and God isn't magically coming to their assistance as they are getting repeatedly raped. Thanks Muhammad!\n\n\n4) This wasn't his only awful decision in marriage and sex slavery. Taking a widow immediately after his army killed her husband, marrying his adopted son's daughter (and then conveniently creating a rule to allow this). And others.\n\n\n5) I love the very selective use of science. Let's ignore so much scientific stuff that makes Islam looks like what it is - a man made ideology created by a warlord to ensure male dominance. Ignore the math error in the perfect book. Ignore the gender discrimination. Ignore the prophet insulting women. Ignore the Islamic \"science\" of telling people to drink camel urine or about child resemblance to parents.\n\n\n6) I respect actual scientific studies so I definitely give this credit. But scientific studies don't necessarily speak to social needs and norms. For example, scientifically the \"survival of the fittest\" strategy is the best to ensure long term strength and survival of a population, but that doesn't mean we should let all sick people die. Many other examples."

A\u00efsha had reached puberty.\nArgument A\u00efsha had reached puberty, so she was ready for marriage. Even if she was in fact 9 years old, this marriage is still justified for the following reasons \u2026 (a) She reached the age of puberty.[81] She must have been an early developer for whom it is most likely her puberty started at 8, and continued till she was 9, and once she was going through puberty and her menses, this made her a lady and not a girl anymore.[82]\nAnswer 1\nThis is untrue. A\u00efsha had still not reached menarche in July 628,[83] fully five years after the consummation of her marriage.\nThe episode in which A\u00efsha was accused of adultery was in January 628, when her age was just short of fourteen.[84] In her long and detailed account of this event, A\u00efsha described herself as a jariya.[85] This Arabic word can only be used for a little girl or a female slave. It is never used for a free woman who has passed puberty. In this context, she also mentioned her light weight, which she attributed to eating so little meat.[86] This \u201clightness\u201d may explain why A\u00efsha reached puberty slightly later than average. Puberty begins when a girl has reached a certain weight; hence it would be expected that A\u00efsha, who was somewhat under-nourished, would be late. A\u00efsha also refers to herself as a jariya in a different incident, when the Abyssinian spearmen were displaying in the mosque courtyard. She reminded her audience how \u201ca girl of tender age is fond of watching sport.\u201d[87] This incident was after her marriage \u2013 but how long after it?\nSince Muhammad had to screen A\u00efsha while she watched the display, it must have occurred after the Order of the Veil, which was certainly no earlier than 5 May 627. We know this because A\u00efsha was still unveiled during the Battle of the Ditch and Siege of the Qurayza.[88] This war ended when Muhammad supervised the extinguishing of the Qurayza tribe on 4 May \u201cfar into the night.\u201d[89] After this he hosted Zaynab\u2019s wedding banquet, where he declared the Order of the Veil.[90] In theory the banquet could have been the next day, 5 May, but this does not leave much time to sleep off the exhaustion of the battle and prepare the feast. So it is more likely that the banquet was a few days later than this. A\u00efsha says that the Abyssinian display occurred during the Mina days,[91] which in 627 fell on 6\u20138 May. Therefore they coincided with or predated Zaynab\u2019s wedding banquet. So while 7 or 8 May 627, when A\u00efsha was thirteen, is a possible date for the Abyssinian display, it would demand a very tight timeline.\nIt is more likely that the incident occurred the following year, on 25\u201327April 628. This was just after the Armistice of Hudaybiya,[92] when A\u00efsha was fourteen and had been restored to favour after the Necklace Affair.[93] Her mother died in the same month, although it is not known whether this was before or after the Mina Days.[94]\nIt is even possible that the spearmen\u2019s display occurred a year later still (14\u201316 April 629), when A\u00efsha was fifteen. Muhammad went to Mecca for the Minor Pilgrimage in March 629 and returned to Medina \u201cin Zu\u2019l-Hijja\u201d (the month that began on 4 April 629).[95] The exact date of his return is not stated, but the Quraysh wanted him out of Mecca before Zu\u2019l-Hijja (the pilgrimage month) began.[96] Since the journey only took about a week, it is safe to say that he arrived in Medina well before the 14 April and that he had time to arrange some festive Mina celebrations. If so, A\u00efsha was still a prepubescent \u201clittle girl\u201d even at the age of fifteen[97] A third incident occurred in July 628,[98] when Muhammad returned from Khaybar and discovered that A\u00efsha, then fourteen and a half, still played with her dolls. He did not mind; he laughed over it.[99] In fact playing with \u201cdolls and similar images\u201d was absolutely forbidden to adults because it was so close to idolatry. Only prepubescent children were allowed to keep dolls.[100] Muhammad was very strict about not allowing his wives to keep images in their houses,[101] so he would certainly have destroyed A\u00efsha\u2019s dolls if he had caught her playing with them after she was too old. The fact that he just laughed over them shows that she was still young enough to keep them, i.e., that she had not reached menarche. While the exact date of A\u00efsha\u2019s menarche is not known, an exact date is not required here. The point is that it was well over five years, and perhaps more than six years, after the consummation of her marriage. Although this could not have been predicted on her wedding day, A\u00efsha actually belonged to the 10% of girls who are latest in reaching puberty.[102] At nine she would have been flat-chested and only three-quarters of her future height; nobody could have mistaken her for an adult. The nine-year-old A\u00efsha was, in every sense of the term, a \u201cchild-bride\u201d.\n\n\nAnswer 2\n\n\nAlthough a few girls do reach menarche as young as age nine, it does not follow that those girls are ready for marriage. No nine-year-old has reached her full height, and a girl whose bones are still growing is definitely not ready for pregnancy."

The Sunnah indicated that, as the Prophet, may God\u2019s prayers and peace be upon him, married Aisha, may God be pleased with her, when she was six years old. And he entered her while she was nine years old. This is evidence from the Sunnah on this issue, and the scholars are unanimously agreed that this is permissible. Imam Al-Bukhari, may God have mercy on him, said in his Sahih: Chapter on the marriage of a man and his young son. Because God Almighty says: (And the one who has not incubated ), so he made her \u2018iddah three months before puberty. Muhammad ibn Yusuf told us, Sufyan told us on the authority of Hisham on the authority of Aisha, may God be pleased with her: that the Prophet, may God\u2019s prayers and peace be upon him, married her when she was six years old, and she entered him when she was nine years old and stayed with him for nine. (And La\u2019i did not incubate He made her \u2018iddah three months before puberty, meaning that her marriage before puberty is permissible, which is a good inference, but there is no in the verse specifying that for the father or the virgin. It can be said that the original in Al-Adaa is forbidden except as indicated by the evidence. The hadith of Aisha was mentioned in the marriage of Abu Bakr to her when she was under puberty, so what other than her remained in the original. For this secret, he cited the hadith of Aisha. Al-Muhallab said: They are unanimously agreed that it is permissible for a father to marry his young daughter even if she does not have intercourse like her: Ended from the ninth part of Fath al-Bari on pages 189-190.\n\nwhich refers to\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/all-in-one-sahih-al-bukhari-eng-arabic/page/6/mode/2up\n\n\u201c67-THE BOOK OF AN-NIKAH (The Wedlock)\n\n\u200e(\u06f3\u06f9) \u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0625\u0646\u0643\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0648\u0644\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u063a\u0627\u0631\u060c \u0644\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0649 : (\u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062d\u0636\u0646\u00bb [\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0642 : 4] \u0641\u062c\u0639\u0644 \u0639\u062f\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0629 \u0623\u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u0648\u063a ."

Bukhari would not have made a separate chapter and not included Q65:4 if he did not think Aisha was prepubescent at consummation.\n\nSahih Muslim Also has a book dedicated to Marriage (Book of Marriage).

Seeking Permission Of A Previously-Married Woman In Words, And Of A Virgin By Silence [3473] 64\n\n(1419) Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah said : \u201cA previously-married woman should not be married until she has been consulted, and a virgin should not be married until her permission has been sought.\u201d They said : \u201cO Messenger of Allah. what is her permission?\u201d He said : \u201cIf she remains silent.\u201d\n\nChapter 10. It Is Permissible For A Father To Arrange The Marriage Of A Young Virgin\n\n[3479] 69\n\n(1422) It was narrated that \u2018Aishah said : \u201cThe Messenger of Allah married me when I was six years old and he lived with me when I was nine years old.\u201d She said : \u201cWe came to Al Madinah and I fell sick for a month and my hair came down to my neck. Umm R\u00fam\u00e2n came to me when I was on a swing and some of my friends were with me. She called me loudly and I went to her, and I did not know what she wanted of me. She took me by the hand and made me stand at the door. I said : \u2018Hah, Hah (as if gasping for breath) until I had calmed down, then she took me into a house where there were some women of the Ansar who said : \u2018With good wishes, and blessings, and good fortune. She handed me over to them and they washed my hair and adorned me, and then suddenly the Messenger of All\u00e2h was there, and they handed me over to him.\u201d\nNo consent needed or asked because a non-baligh virgin is too young for consent.\n\nIbn Majah in his book of Marriage also baligh virgins have consent, minors do not.\n\nChapter 11. Seeking The Consent Of Virgins And Previously-Married Women\n\n1870. It was narrated from Ibn \u2018Abb\u00e2s that the Messenger of All\u00e2h said : \u201cA widow has more right (to decide), concerning herself than her guardian, and a virgin should be consulted.\u201d It was said : \u201cO Messenger of Allah, a virgin may be too shy to speak.\u201d He said : \u201cHer consent is her silence.\u201d (Sahih)\nhttps://archive.org/details/AllInOne-Hadiths-EngArabicDarusalam_201407/All%20in%20One-Sunan-Ibn%20Majah-Eng/page/n1135/mode/2up\n\nChapter 13. Marriage of Minor Girls Arranged By Their Fathers\n\n1876. It was narrated that Aishah said : \u201cThe Messenger of All\u00e2h married me when I was six years old. Then we came to Al-Madinah and settled among Banu Harith bin Khazraj. I \u201cbecame ill and my hair fell out, then it grew back and became abundant. My mother Umm Rum\u00e2n came to me while I was on an Urjuhah with some of my friends, and called for me. I went do her, and I did not know what she wanted. She took me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house, and I was panting. When I got my breath back, she took some water and wiped my face and head, and led me into the house. There were some woman of the Ans\u00e1r inside the house, and they said : \u201cWith the blessings and good fortune (from Allah). (My mother) handed me over to them and they tidied me up. And suddenly I saw the Messenger of Allah in the morning. And she handed me over to him and I was at that time, nine years old.\u201d (Sahih)\nIbn Majah categorised Aisha as a minor. Aisha was not asked for consent because she was prepubescent. It also adds the note after the hadith (p 77):\n\nComments : a. The marriage bond of a girl who is not yet adult (has not reached the age of puberty) is perfectly valid in Islam. b. Urjuhah refers to both, a swing and a seesaw; it is a long piece of wood, its middle is placed at a high place and the children sit on both ends, when its one side goes down the other side goes up; it is called seesaw in English. c. It is recommended to beautify the bride when she leaves for her husband\u2019s home.\n\nThat is what Islam legalized."

                "body": ">The point from the article is \"physical puberty matched psychosocial maturity in the past\" psychosocial maturity is defined in the article as the ability to function adequately as an adult.\n\nYes, the article does state that. But this is explaining the past phenomena/trend that **on average** women reached psychosocial maturity in line with physical puberty. However, you cannot then claim that if a women reached physical puberty earlier (due to genetic/environmental reasons) then they also reach psychosocial maturity earlier too. The articles says nothing about that, and merely states the trend. Like I said, the article uses Roman law and norms of the time to determine psychosocial maturity 2000 years ago, which is **distinct** from physical puberty. \n\n>Was Aisha Physically Mature when Muhammad married her if yes then there is nothing morally wrong about that because she was very likely psychosocially mature also, if no then it is morally wrong to marry her\n\nI don't think it's as simple as that. Child marriages are also morally wrong because of the risk child pregnancies can have based on studies of female development and child-bride mortality rate being high due to pregnancies. \n\n\"With the onset of puberty, the female developmental trajectory diverges substantially from the childhood trajectory, whereas the male trajectory essentially continues its earlier course (Table S2). As a result, the female pelvis attains its obstetrically most favorable morphology around the age of 25\u201330 y, i.e., at the age of highest fertility\" [\\[source\\]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1517085113)\n\n\"The greatest danger, however, is to the pelvic floor. Girls may start ovulating and menstruating as early as age 9, though the average is around 12 to 13. (Some studies suggest that the\u00a0[average age of first menstruation](https://www.livescience.com/8448-girls-entering-puberty-younger-ages-study-suggests.html)\u00a0is dropping, but the data is not conclusive.) Just because a girl can get pregnant, though, doesn't mean she can safely deliver a baby. The pelvis does not fully widen until the late teens, meaning that young girls may not be able to push the baby through the birth canal.\" [\\[source\\]](https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html)\n\nIf Allah allowed marriages after menarche and psychosocial maturity, then why did he make pregnancy and child birth extremely dangerous for those under 15? Unless you believe the human body has changed significantly in the last 1400 years? I've also seen you link articles where a girl gives birth as young as 10 with no health complications, but that is just one case. I can link you cases where a smoker live past the age of 100 while smoking everyday. Should we then say that smoking is not dangerous? [\\[source\\]](https://www.newsweek.com/worlds-oldest-man-guinness-world-record-smoking-tobacco-fredie-blom-947687)\n\n>the article uses approximations, likely ages at each era which admits of exceptions, from 1400 years old, and as young as 9 some women can reach physical maturity, do you deny that?\n\nYes, the article does talk cases of *Precocious and early-onset puberty,* but no where does it state that a person who reaches puberty earlier also reaches maturity earlier. Do you agree that the age of psychosocial maturity is dependent on the society (as the article states)? \n\n>so it is still possible that Aisha was physically mature and indeed the historical evidence says that Aisha was physically mature\n\nSo is the possibility of her not being mature? You say not to bring up the doll narrative, but people do bring this up because it conflicts with several fatwas that say that dolls/images are only allowed for those who have not reached puberty [\\[source\\]](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9473/exemption-of-baby-dolls-from-the-ruling-on-haram-images). You can disagree with them or the hadith, but it just shows how hard it is to accurately judge her maturity. \n\nI think the biggest issue I have with Aisha's marriage is that it permits some Muslims and Islamic countries to do child marriages, which we know can be extremely harmful. Anyone can claim that a girl is already 'mature' enough for marriage, because Islamic fiqh does not really give a good indicator of what maturity is. I've already cited the health issues with child pregnancies. You can claim the Prophet married Aisha as a product of his time, but he is meant to be a timeless role model. So, what stops other Muslims from following him and marrying people as young as 6?"

Their mismatch is a recent phenomena.\n\nAisha was physically mature (the Islam says physical maturation \"usually\" means menarche which develops \"usually\" after the development of the secondary sexual charcharistics and the ability of the girl to have safe penerative sex (the size of vagina is ok .. etc) \"no harm no reciprocating harm\" the marriage shouldn't cause more harm than the benefits, that is why the majority of Islamic scholars justify the waiting for 3 years after the marriage contract. She was physically mature and it is not \"impossible\" to be physically mature at 9 years from 1400 years. You have to prove that all girls in this era cannot be mature as young as 9 which is impossible.\n\nThere is an \"increased possible risk\" not \"confirmed risk\" for early marriage but again you cannot generalise on all girls in all eras and all societies that is the same fallacy, a lot of girls can have sex and be pregnant without problems at young ages even in these days, and in the past the benefits of early marriage outweigh these \"possible\" risks. There are possible risks of anything, excessive mobile phone use possible risk cancer, but the benefits of using phone outweigh these risks so you use it.\n\nAs i said playing with dolls is usually considered an immature act \"today\" but in the past girls had nothing to do except marriage, playing, house work, reproduction, there were no women's career nor women's education, etc. so playing with dolls in the past doesn't necessarily means that the person who plays with them is immature, even today you can find mature women who play with dolls .. and again you will have to negate tons of other narratives which indicate that Aisha was happy in that marriage and that she wasn't harmed by it which indicates her psychological well-being."

                "body": ">Bro, the article states that physical maturity matched psychosocial maturity in the past, **so if physical maturation occured earlier that means psychosocial maturation likely also had occured**, because they are matched together. Their mismatch is a recent phenomena\n\nI need a citation on this, because no where does it state that. As I've told you, the article uses the societal environment to determine when psychosocial maturity developed:\n\n>With settlement, childhood disease and postnatal undernutrition became common, and therefore the average age of menarche was delayed. **This matched the increasing complexity of society following the development of agriculture, settlement and population aggregation, which in turn led to the differentiation of social tasks and the creation of societal hierarchies.**\n\nThe author states that psychosocial maturity, because of the **complexity of society**, matches menarche. The author never states that early menarche results in earlier maturity. \n\n>... She was physically mature and it is not \"impossible\" to be physically mature at 9 years from 1400 years. You have to prove that all girls in this era cannot be mature as young as 9 which is impossible.\n\nIf you mean physically mature to bear children without risks and complications, then I can prove that all 9 years old's, biologically, are immature to have kids. [\\[source\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9859398/)\n\n* Teenage pregnancy is associated with risks for adverse delivery outcomes: stillbirth, preterm birth and low birth weight. \n* Teenagers seem to have insufficient gestational weight gain resulting in low birthweight infants and intergenerational malnutrition later.\n* Newly born mortality rate in teenage pregnancies is about **3 times** higher than in adult women, and the risk of maternal deaths due to medical complications is **2 times** higher.\n\nAs I linked to you before, the literature is clear that Pelvic floor muscles are severely undeveloped in people under 15 years old for pregnancies. **This is not affected by puberty** [\\[source\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534827/)**.** I don't know what you mean by \"increased possible risk\" and \"confirmed risk\", but I have shown you how early pregnancy is **harmful,** the same way smoking is. If you smoke everyday, it is not 'confirmed' that you will get lung cancer, but the chances are significantly higher that we can still say it's harmful. Thus, you cannot claim it is 'impossible' to say child pregnancies are harmful, unless you're willing to concede that nothing can be 'harmful'.\n\n>in the past the benefits of early marriage outweigh these \"possible\" risks.\n\nWhich is also why, the Roman and Byzantine laws time regarding marriage and female maturity were closer to 12-15 years of age, and definitely not as young as 6 or 9. \n\n>...narratives which indicate that Aisha was happy in that marriage and that she wasn't harmed by it which indicates her psychological well-being.\n\nI'm not here to argue hadith, because it is incredibly conflicting. But, I did argue how what we know about human anatomy proves that Aisha's consummation was inherently harmful. If you want to prove to me how 9 year old's can achieve this 'physical maturity' of marriage and childbirth, then I'd be glad to hear it. Don't just give me a single news article or say that I can't say this applies to all women, when you need to prove that."

In fact, I assumed that the Prophet had intercourse with his 9-year old bride for the sake of reproducing, or are you suggesting the intentions were something else? \n\nEven then, you should know that sex will always come at the risk of pregnancy, unless Aisha had fertility issues, which is impossible to know at that age. \n\n>how can a person who reached menarche/developed secondary physical characteristics {breasts, pubic, underarm hair, capacity to take a penis inside etc ... be considered immature biologically speaking?\n\nIf you think women are biologically mature because they can take a penis inside of her, that is a bit naive. Without proper contraceptives, a women can easily become pregnant, and if she is unable to have a safe pregnancy (mind you, we're talking about the seventh century here), then maybe she shouldn't have sex?\n\n>Physical maturity= menarche/secondary sexual characteristics+ability to have penerative sex. who define physical maturity as the ability to bear a child without risks and complications? This is your own definition not a medicinal defination.\n\nI think the better word here would be puberty. Humans very much still develop physically and biologically way after puberty. I wasn't sure what you meant initially, which is why I defined it as I did, so it was clear. \n\n>Aisha was mature biologically but at higher risk of these complications, ok. and I said in the past the benefits of early marriage outweigh these potential complications\n\nWhat benefits are these marrying that early at 6? If it's because of the low life expectancy, then why didn't Mohammad marry Aisha at the age of 12-14, like the norms of the time?\n\n>Your case can be refuted easily by citing girls as young as 9 and 10 who can deliver a child without physical problems and who remain healthy also their babies after delivery. Use Google and you will find a lot of these cases in the past and even in now-day societies. Aisha could be one of these cases.\n\nI think you might need to provide sources for this. I've provided lots of sources why it's harmful to the child, you need to provide research that says otherwise."

Both mother and baby are in good health. (https://en.royanews.tv/news/29201).\n\nBy the way Aisha never carried a child so she wasn't physically harmed right? So why the prophet action is wrong morally?\n\nHe married a biologically mature/psychosocially mature person according to her societal environment. And she never carried a baby which means even if we granted you your argument that all girls in all eras in all societies will and must suffer from physical problems if they became pregnant at that age, Aisha is an exception because she never carried a baby in her entire life. \n\nSo why is it morally wrong to marry biologically mature/psychologically mature person without harming them physically??\n\nAgain what the prophet did is not morally wrong, and there are other reasons that can be said why he married her at that young age which has nothing to do with any sexual activity, and the history of his marriage indicate without doubt that he wasn't concerned mainly by sex.\n\nYour problem seems to me that you are saying because Muhammad married Aisha at 9 years it is possible for any Muslim to marry any girl at 9 years and that is wrong, because the circumstances may vary.\n\nThe Qur'an or Sunna don't say go all adults marry 9 years old girls, that is wrong the general role is \"no harm, nor reciprocating harm\" this rule can be applied to any situation and any society and it is a basic Islamic rule.\n\nif marrying a girl at 9 will cause potential physical problems if she became pregnant without outweighing benefits then it is wrong to do so or use contraception or physical barrier during sex till she reaches appropriate age etc.\n\nProphet Muhammad hadn't violated this rule,  because Aisha was never pregnant and also she could be pubescent enough at that age to carry a healthy child without physical problems."

How do you think seventh century medicine will be any better? Even the 11-year old girl had to be attended by experts and monitored in the hospital.\n\n>By the way Aisha never carried a child so she wasn't physically harmed right? So why the prophet action is wrong morally?\n\nI can only argue with you the biological reasons why a child that age should not get married/sex. If we argue psychological, then it's harder because you claim she was mature, so I won't do that. It is still morally wrong, because every time Mohammad had sex with her, there was a chance that she could have gotten pregnant. If I drunk drive without hurting anyone, does that mean drinking while driving is ok? In fact, I could be one of those people that has a high tolerance of alcohol and I'm really good at driving. So, should I do it?\n\n>other reasons that can be said why he married her at that young age which has nothing to do with any sexual activity, and the history of his marriage indicate without doubt that he wasn't concerned mainly by sex.\n\nI have asked for these other reasons. Aisha was already promised to someone that was more around her age.\n\n>Your problem seems to me that you are saying because Muhammad married Aisha at 9 years it is possible for any Muslim to marry any girl at 9 years and that is wrong, because the circumstances may vary.\n\nAnyone can claim that a 9-year old girl is ready for sex, because the fiqh surrounding what is 'mentally' mature is quite vague. I want you to give me specific attributes of Aisha that made her mentally prepared to get married, that is different to the 9-year old's we have today."

Physical maturity matched psychosocial maturity in the past, The graph uses approximations/likely ages only but it clearly states in the past who reached physical puberty would also reach psychosocial puberty.\n\n2. So the question becomes \"was aisha physically mature?\" The answer is yes and the majority of Islamic scholars agree on that, she reached menarche and that means she developed secondary sexual charachatristics and she must be physically able to have intercourse otherwise it is prohibited in Islam to marry who cannot physically have intercourse, so from 1 she reached psychosocial maturity. Nothing wrong in marrying such girl.\n\n3. Pregnancy harms bullshit, she wasn't pregnant fair enough, so she suffered no physical harm, and by the way in the Islamic texts it is mentioned also that God ordered him to marry her, so God may told him that she could not be pregnant (but he told no one not to harm her emotionally) so there is nothing wrong in having sex with physically/psychosocially mature girl which you know cannot be pregnant + your supposed pregnancy harms don't occur in all eras and societies and to all personalities at that age, I linked you above 9 years old girl giving birth to healthy child and she was healthy and all girls should now deliver at hospitals lol that is the norm of your society, your position cannot be refuted if I brought you nowday girls you would say they are healthy because of the medical advances and if I brought you historical cases you would ask me to prove scientifically not anecdotally that they weren't harmed physically by early pregnancy which is impossible lol? How can I bring 1400 years ago girls for clinical observations? What should I do to refute you then? \n\n4. Islam doesn't say all adults go marry girls as young as 9, nope in Islam it is forbidden to cause harm without outweighing benefits, by today standards the harms outweigh the benefits, so you cannot marry girls at 9 or even at 15 now. Personalities differ, circumstances differ there is no single age for marriage in all eras and societies."

I explained to you that this is a graph of **trends**, and nowhere in the original article you cite does it say this.\n\n>\"was aisha physically mature?\"\u00a0\n\nMy position is simple: If you have sex with a 9-year old child during the 7th century, you risk getting her pregnant. A 9-year old that is pregnant will be at risk for a harmful pregnancy, as I cited, and this does not matter with **puberty.**\n\n>Pregnancy harms bullshit, she wasn't pregnant fair enough, so she suffered no physical harm,\n\nYou didn't answer my drunk driving analogy, so I guess you think it's ok for people to drink and drive if they don't hurt anyone?\n\n>\u00a0linked you above 9 years old girl giving birth to healthy child\n\nI don't think you know how giving birth works in a hospital. The link you deleted earlier stated that the child had to undergo C-section or else she could have died due to her being incredibly young. Unfortunately, I do not understand what you mean after this.\n\n>Islam doesn't say all adults go marry girls as young as 9, nope in Islam it is forbidden to cause harm without outweighing benefits\n\nYet, Islam allows marriages as young as 9. You agree with me about the harmful affects of child pregnancies. Would you agree it would be more beneficial if the age of marriage was raised to 15 lunar years?  In Islam, if you pass [15 lunar years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baligh) without any signs of secondary sexual characteristics, you were automatically considered an adult, so why not set the age of marriage to this?"

You can see other translations of the Quran, and you won't find this added description of *Nur*.\n\n\n\n> Not a native Arabic speaker, so maybe someone who is can correct me, but *Nur* has always meant light. Arabic has the word \u0627\u0646\u0639\u0643\u0627\u0633 or \u0639\u0643\u0633 which mean \"reflection\".\n\n\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the moon has *reflected* light, for which a word already exists for in the Arabic language. It is thus way more likely that the Quran, a man made book, got science wrong. It's highly unlikely that a just and fair god would hide his message under ambiguous translations of words."

The dictionary that Lane took it from is not remotely contemporary, a man in 1572 realised the Quran was wrong as many astronomers had long proven the moon is the sun's light - however noor just means light, so he added a new definition into the book to help cover the scientific error.\n\nSee the sources and links to Lanes Lexicon pages linked here: https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Scientific_Errors_in_the_Quran#Nature_of_the_moon's_light\n\n\nIn Lane's Lexicon of classical arabic, the word muneer (\u0645\u064f\u0651\u0646\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064b) is defined as 'Giving light, shining bright, bright, or shining brightly'.\n\n Noor is defined on the previous page as 'Light; whatever it may be; and the rays thereof'.In reference to Quran 10:5 (quoted above) which describe the moon with this word, Lane writes, 'In the Kur. x. 5, the sun is termed \u0636\u064a\u0627\u0621 and the moon \u0646\u0648\u0631 and it is said that \u0636\u064a\u0627\u0621 is essential, but \u0646\u0648\u0631 is accidental [light]'. \n\n**The notion of essential and accidental light and its application to the sun and moon originates not from the Arabs at the time of the Qur'an, but rather from the book Kitab al-Manazir, commonly known as 'Optics', published in 1572 by the great polymath and optics pioneer al-Hazen.** Lane goes on to say, citing the highly regarded Taj al-Arus classical dictionary, 'it [light] is of two kinds, the light of the present world and that of the world to come; and the former is either perceived sensibly, by the eye, and this is what diffuses itself from luminous bodies, as the sun and moon and stars, and is mentioned in the Kur. x. 5 referred to above'."

However, since the Arabic language has two different words for \"light,\" Muslims decided to make a claim that there is a difference in meaning between the two. They claimed that something that emits \"Daw'\" radiates light itself, while something that emits \"Nur\" is something that reflects light from another source. This is nonsense, and there is no linguistic evidence for it. However, since Arabic is the liturgical language of Islam, who would refute the claims that Muslim scholars pull out of their @$$es?!!\n\nThere's another famous verse that describes Allah's \"light,\" and the word used in it is Allah's \"Nur,\" not \"Daw'.\" Does that mean that God reflects light from an external source? \ud83e\udd14"

                "body": "So most of you keep mentioning that Allah is described as Nur as well, but that doesn\u2019t seem like a strong argument, since Arabic words have different meanings especially based on context. This is a good answer in this regard:\n\nQur\u2019an is a highly contextual text. It\u2019s not a normal book of science, mathematics, or business, where you can simply interpret what you read.\n\nAlthough the word Noor is used for both Allah (as an attribute) and moon, it doesn\u2019t mean the same.\n\nAlso, Quran does not directly mention that moon has a reflected light. It simply says moon is \u201cNur\u201d, whereas Sun is \u201cSiraj\u201d. The word Nur means radiance, and Siraj means lamp which emits light. Hence, we form a conclusion that moon does not have it\u2019s own light, otherwise Siraj word would\u2019ve been used for moon as well.\n\nNow, from this comparison, one can\u2019t say that Allah\u2019s Nur (radiance) is because of some other light source! The context is different. In verse 71:16, Allah is discussing about astronomy, whereas in 25:35, Allah is giving an example of his guidance, and how Allah is Nur (through the doctrine of oneness and his presence in this universe), both physically and philosophically.\n\nHere is an example from Qur\u2019an:\n\nQur\u2019an 3:29\n\nSay: \u201cWhether you conceal what is in your hearts or reveal it, Allah will know it.\u201d He knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. Allah is powerful over everything (\u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0634\u064e\u0649\u0652\u0621\u064d ).\n\nHere, the word \u201ceverything\u201d means literally everything you can imagine or even beyond that.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at another verse having the same word \u201ceverything ( \u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0634\u064e\u0649\u0652\u0621\u064d )\u201d (same in Arabic as well):\n\nQur\u2019an 27:16\n\nAnd Sulaim\u0101n inherited D\u0101w\u016bd and said, \u201cO people we have been taught the speech of birds, and everything ( \u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0634\u064e\u0649\u0652\u0621\u064d ) has been given to us. Indeed, this is the evident grace (of Allah).\u201d\n\nHere, the word everything doesn\u2019t mean literally everything.\n\nDid prophet Sulaiman have all the land and water of the world under his ownership? No. Did he have the ownership of sun and moon? No.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the meaning of the verse either! When we say, \u201cGod has given me everything\u201d, by that we mean that God is fulfilling all my necessities and I\u2019m living a satisfactory life.\n\nSo, although the word is same, it can mean different based on logic and context."

Obviously it won\u2019t say LGBTQ, but anything from God that states this is something they had to do, when they came across people who chose this lifestyle?"

It's not because hindus believe in reincarnation and they can get away with it, there's stuff about karma in hinduism too related to your next life. All rape cases have a common denominator that is their attitude towards women, whether that be treating them as second class citizens or baby producers or whatever ancient fuckers deemed it be. \n\nAny religion that discriminates between genders is at fault. It has nothing to do with what they state happens after death, most people don't think much about the afterlife and death until their health is failing."

Like you can't just choose to believe something you don't believe in. I don't think he would like that very much.\n\nI would probably say, given that the lack of evidence for any of these religions and gods is the same, and given that the real god is fair and understanding, he would understand you not believing and picking a random religion to believe in. The best thing to do is just live your life like normal, be a nice person, and not worry about a practically infinite number of potential gods and afterlives. Pascal's wager doesn't really make sense.\n\nEdit: and I didn't even mention if the real god was strict about how you followed their religion, and whether you are in the correct sect or school of thought."

That's why he rewards atheists with Mexican food Paradise, while condemning all theists (other than the chosen few, like myself, who are his prophets and followers) to boil for eternity in the cosmic enchilada sauce.\n\nPascal's wager therefore states that to avoid eternal torment, you should be an atheist.  And there's just as much reason to believe in Steve as there is any other hypothetical god."

If said God does exist, I wouldn't be able to fool God by \"pretending\" to believe. I can't believe in Islam \"just in case\" Allah exists. It doesn't make sense.\n\nSecondly, Pascal's wager can apply to any religion not just Islam. Even if I did \"choose\" to believe in the Islamic version of God, how can I ever know that I'm not wrong about any other religion for sure? It's futile to even guess the odds of any religion being true. So far in my experience, it's very likely that none of these religions are true. Not all of them can be correct but they can definitely all be false.\n\nThirdly, I disagree that nothing happens if I believed in God my entire life and God doesn't exist. I see that religions, especially like Islam, are all encompassing. They completely take over you as an individual and your mind. Your life revolves around this one idea and a lot of your time and energy are spent trying to fulfill these religious obligations. If God doesn't exist, I would have wasted a lifetime trying to fulfill the orders of a non-existent being.\n\nIf God doesn't exist and I didn't believe in God, then I would have lived a life that was meaningful and fulfilling to me and made memories that will continue to live with my family and friends. Ofcourse a religious person can still do this but perhaps with less focus and intent especially if they believe this life is temporary.\n\nI don't know for sure if there is another life to live after this but I am absolutely sure that I am experiencing one right now. Why should I gamble with this life by restricting myself from things that I may or may not get in heaven?"

So I wonder what you'll think when you die and go to hell because the right religion was actually a cult with 13 members in the middle of nowhere hundreds of years ago.

But if you want to hear an atheist\u2019s view on Pascal\u2019s Wager, I can take you through what I think of it.\n\nI think Pascal\u2019s Wager is misleading at best. Pascal was talking about the Christian god. However there are many gods that people believe in. Even though many claim that the Islamic god is the same as the Christian god, I think even you will agree that the idea of trinity is invalid in Islam. In fact, it is considered shirk. So, I as an atheist have to ask, which god are you talking about?\n\nAlso, just believing in any God doesn\u2019t give you eternal happiness; because gods are jealous. Allah will definitely throw you in hell if you worshipped Krishna all your life.\n\nEven allowing for the Islamic god doesn\u2019t solve this issue. Assuming we are talking about Allah, believing in him doesn\u2019t guarantee you eternal happiness, you have to make sure you are in the subsect of the subsect that is the only correct one. Sunnis condemn Shias all the time and vice verse, Ahmediyas condemn other Muslims and vice versa. Barelwis condemn non barelwis etc etc\n\nSo in effect, you are not betting on whether there is a god or not. You are betting on one god against an inifinity of other gods. You are betting against infinity."

I Can\u2019t believe in 2024 people are still clinging to these ancient fables written in parables thousands of years ago.  \n\nAnswer me this, why would god present no evidence of himself being real (save for what a few self proclaimed prophets claimed over thousands of years) only to punish people so severely for not believing in the lack of evidence provided?  Muhammed\u2019s anecdotal story written 1400 years ago is not proof of anything.  Nor was Moses\u2019s story, nor was Jesus\u2019s story.  i believe Jesus was a great orator and philosopher and taught peace and love in a barbaric world.  So he did good for people and was a benefit despite just being a man.  If you just do unto others as you would have them do unto you this world would be a much more wonderful place than it is.  \n\nIt all makes no sense.  If god is real and hell is real then god\u2019s a real piece of shit for torturing people for simply not believing in him.  Like a god would make this world and all the people in it only to provide no evidence of him being real and then make people suffer unnecessarily for it.  It\u2019s too bad Muhammad came along and stole the Jewish/Christian religion and spread his insane ideas by the sword.  He\u2019s not a very good role model at all.  At least Jesus was preaching peace and love.  At least he influenced people in a good way.  I see a lot of barbarity in the Islamic world.  Not everyone is of course but enough are to be alarmed about it. \n\nI\u2019m not worried about eternal damnation at all.  I\u2019m more worried about people with insane beliefs creating hell on earth by forcing their insanity onto others and causing violence in the name of their insane beliefs."

                "body": "Firstly I dont condone following a religion simply because of Pascal\u2019s wager, but it is an interesting thought experiment that can get you halfway there and open the door to further searching.\n\nAll Pascal\u2019s wager does is logically deduces that being a theist instead of atheist makes the most logical sense. After that it is a (relatively) simple matter of following the evidence for the truth of each religion and coming to your own conclusion, with logical deduction.\n\nFor example, Hinduism is fine with you worshipping different gods, even outside its pantheon. So a Christian would still be saved in their eyes. But Christianity does not assert that at all and claims Jesus is the way. So you can eliminate Hinduism safely. Other pantheistic religions are the same.\n\nNow you\u2019re left mostly with Christianity, Islam and a few sects that claim to be christians (Jehovah\u2019s witness, LDS, etc) that are exclusive in nature.\n\nHere again you follow the evidence in an unbiased manner and come to your own conclusion. Even if you pick wrong, all these religions claim a maximally good and merciful God who will judge based on your knowledge and the honest conclusions you made based on that (even Islam). So even if you pick wrongly among these you will be fine as long as you live a good life (\u201cgood\u201d being largely the same in all these religions)\n\nSo, even with the \u201climitations\u201d of Pascal\u2019s wager it clearly supports becoming a believer in **something** rather than nothing.\n\nAgain I dont condone believing just to avoid hell, but you can logically go far enough to make a rational choice. Personally this is how I became a Christian (and then specifically Catholic). There is plenty of evidence there for those looking for it.\n\n\u201cAsk, and it will be given you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.\u201d\n\u202d\u202dMatthew\u202c \u202d7\u202c:\u202d7\u202c"

Why would I pick any of those when there's so many choices. I refuse to play!\" \n\n\"Oh, okay.\" \\*BANG\\* \n\n  \nSo yeah, no. The best move is not \"not to play\". That's actually the worst move. Instead of having any chance at salvation, even a slim one, you choose no chance. \n\nPersonally, my money is on Christianity. It comes from a perspective that's much less human. The God of Christianity accepts nothing less than perfect, and so no-one is worthy, but God is also loving, so provides a way for people to be accepted anyway. The heaven of Christianity is described as more of an abstract place of belonging, purpose and celebration. Rather than a coomer fantasy about hoors. \n\nPlus, there are practical benefits. I mean, the bar to entry is on the floor. You literally just need to ask for forgiveness and you're good to go. Then there's the moral teachings, which are all about forgiveness, acceptance, not judging people based on their position within society, kindness and generosity, empathy and caring for others, etc. Good principles that are not just easy to follow for genuinely good people but principles that will actually make people better people for following them. \n\nFor what it's worth Buddhism also sounds pretty good, from what I know, but it's barrier to entry is sky high with you having to meditate for decades to reach nirvana. I think I'd count reincarnation as a kind of hell. I mean, that's a lot of death and suffering over those multiple lives, and it's eternal until you escape the cycle by achieving nirvana. \n\nOh, and there's usually some overlap. There are Christians that believe any good people will go to heaven. There are Muslims that believe that Christianity is close enough, just because they share Jesus/Isa. Etc.   \nSo by choosing one religion you're potentially covering more bases than you think you are. \n\n\n\nEither way, you're still better off picking a religion rather than no religion."

So by choosing one religion you're potentially covering more bases than you think you are.\n\nYou are doing calculations to raise up your chances of going into paradise, which makes you not sincere in your belief as you are acting by interest. This is one of the many criticisms against the Pascal's Wager, and I doubt that a god won't see you.\n\n> Instead of having any chance at salvation, even a slim one, you choose no chance.\n\nI always find it interesting that there are believers out there giving contradictory statements. God is merciful/perfect/reasonable but he won't hesitate to send you to the pits of hell for not believing to him, despite the actual number of different beliefs out there that he didn't do anything to stop them ? This is unreasonable from a god, but maybe not from a human dictator."

                "body": "But there isn\u2019t clear evidence/proof is there?  What are these 124,000 messengers you speak of?  Just because that was written down by some idiot 1400 years ago in a Hadith doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true.  That\u2019s not evidence.  People had some crazy beliefs back then.  They had no science or understanding of the universe.  Some places in this world have evolved past these crazy ancient beliefs due to the idea of secularism.  Islam is threatening to de-evolve us back to the stone ages if it spreads around the world and infects the west.  The scientific institutions will be under attack.  The only reason the Islamic world has any modern technology at all is because it was given to them by the secular western world which evolved past the need of these ancient beliefs and ended up modernizing the world.  I don\u2019t think the burden of proof lies with me in proving that these ancient writings were fables.  I think the burden of proof lies with you in proving that they are the true word of god.  There is no way of proving that ancient writings were written by god. And logically if god had written the Quran I think he would have done a better job of writing it.  If god did write it then he\u2019s clearly not that bright.  And I think if god did exist he would be a lot smarter than to leave us with that shitty book to go by.  I mean come on clearly the idea that man was molded out of mud and clay is clearly the idea of man.  It\u2019s all made up.  \n\nIf god was a just and loving god, do you think he would be so cruel as to punish a woman so severely for adultery that she should be buried half way into the ground and have large stones thrown at her head until she is dead?  That\u2019s barbaric and extremely cruel.  I don\u2019t care if Muhammad had that woman stoned to death because she asked to be punished due to feeling remorse.  A just and loving god would be gracious enough to be about forgiveness.  That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s just one of the many contrasts as to why Jesus was such a better role model for a society than Muhammad was and why the Christian world is so much more peaceful today than the Islamic world is.  Upon the entire town wanting to stone a woman for adultery, Jesus said to the townspeople, \u201clet he who is without sin cast the first stone\u201d and the people dropped their stones and all went home because they all realized they had sinned at some point in their lives and she deserved just as much forgiveness as any of them.  That showed an act of compassion, mercy, tolerance, kindness and love.  All of the best human traits to aspires to.  Muhammad did the opposite.  \n\nJust look around at the Islamic world today.  Women are being beaten by shariah police for not wearing their hijabs correctly.  If a woman gets raped she needs at least four male witnesses to exonerate her otherwise she won\u2019t be believed and will be beaten and lashed for enticing the male, instead of the rapist being punished.  (That is a very misogynistic and sexist idea in the Quran).  That\u2019s why the Islamic world has a rape culture.  Women are second class citizens.  Women tend to be treated like property, made to just cook, clean and raise babies.  Girls are married off at 13 or 14 years of age often against their will to much older men.   We view that as pedophilia here in the west.  we treat women with equality here.  A woman should be free to choose how to dress, who to love and marry, where to go, and what to do with their bodies.  Many Muslim men behave badly towards women because they are given wives instead of having to court them.  If men had to work for a woman\u2019s affection the societies would be a lot better and men would behave better towards them.  \n\n230 million women have had their clitoris cut off in the FGM countries (that is disgusting and barbaric and should be stopped immediately).  Gay people can\u2019t come out of the closet for fear of being killed.  People who stop believing in religion are considered apostates and should be killed according to Islamic scholars and imams today.  \n\nThose ideas don\u2019t bring progress to a species.  We have accomplished so much as a species.  We have sent satellites into space, the James Webb space telescope is sending images back down to earth of distant galaxies and planets and black holes.  That\u2019s way more fascinating than some ancient book written by men who had some barbaric beliefs 1400 years ago.  Humanity could truly flourish if people moved on past these ancient beliefs.  But If islam keeps spreading across the world as nations take in these crazy believers out of some compassionate goal then I fear that all of the great human progress will be lost as barbarity takes over and destabilizes the world.  Would you want to go back to living like they did 1400 years ago?  Thats where we\u2019ll be headed with Islam spreading across the globe.  Secularism is the only path towards progress.  Islam threatens to derail that progress."

                "body": "What makes belief sincere? I believe the earth is round. When I was young I read stories in which the earth was flat and I heard that some people believed it was flat. I asked around and learned about the curvature of the earth, what the horizon is and why everything looks flat when it's not. I then chose to believe that the world was round instead of flat, because that's the most reasonable belief. \n\nIn Christianity, God doesn't demand an ethereal belief that's based purely on emotions. In fact, you can have belief that's based entirely on logic and reason. \n\nEssentially, the idea that belief has to be inherent is a false premise, and the conclusion you reach based off it is flawed as a result. \n\n  \nGod is harsh, for sure, but that doesn't mean he isn't also loving. The way I would describe it is that God is the most OCD cleanfreak you've ever met, and sin, to him, is like a layer of dirt and grime. The most morally upstanding people in the world may only have some smudges or splatters of dirt but God isn't going to accept any of them into his home because he absolutely can't stand even the slightest amount. That being said, he doesn't want to just leave everyone out in the cold. So essentially he sent his son outside the house to give everyone a ticket that will let them into the \"super squeaky clean bathhouse\" next door. Anyone that goes into the bathhouse comes out clean and is then welcomed into God's house. Anyone that doesn't has to stay outside, dirty and cold. \n\nWould I personally have different rules for letting sinful people into heaven? Sure. However, I'm not God, unfortunately.   \nIf there really is a god out there, it makes perfect sense for them to not be whatever we want them to be. That's fantasy and wish fulfilment, not trying to engage with reality and the God that might be there. \n\nI mean, read your own statement \"This is unreasonable from a god\". According to you? Some random human amid billions? Have you even taken the time to consider what it would be like being God? Not from a human perspective where being nice is good and being bad is bad, but from a perspective of absolute moral neutral. Where pain and happiness aren't even concepts until you invent them. Just there, in an endless void with nothing to do and absolute power. Every world you could build you already know every moment of. It's like if you were to sit down to write a book but you already knew every word from every page, and there's no-one to share it with. Would you even bother writing it? \n\nPerhaps we're all akin to characters in a book. Good, bad, neutral, etc. We've all had our endings planned out from the start, which means some people are specifically created in order to be bastards and to be sent to hell. Perhaps the value to God in playing the story out is the perspectives of the characters (us) as we live through it.   \nTo us, from our point of view, all the suffering, sadness and the idea of hell is unreasonable and unnecessary. However, if what's valuable to God is the variety of emotions, stories and moralities that play out, it makes sense for him to have created a world with both good and evil. Is that fair to us? You could argue it isn't, but how often do human authors consider the feelings of their characters when they create their stories? We too craft villains because it brings tension and drama to a story. It makes it interesting. \n\nThe bible says, right at the very start, that humans are made in God's image. So I think it's reasonable to conclude that God has a similar mentality during creation as we do. Authors often love their characters, even if they write tragedy into their stories. I think God is likely the same. \n\n  \nEither way, Pascal's wager is much more simple than people are making it out to be. It's literally just \"A chance, or no chance\".   \nIt's not a conclusive argument on it's own, it's just part of an overall argument. It suggests that believing in any religion is better than believing in no religion. I just added in my above comment that Christianity seems like the best option to me, because that was the question the original commenter was asking, even if he was being rhetorical and had no interest in actually understanding the argument."

So I've kinda got that base covered anyway. \n\nThe only way that not playing could be a good option is if there's a reward for being an atheist. But that would be really stupid because there would have to be some kind of afterlife or God that rewards atheism, which is the belief that there is no afterlife or God. So it would be a huge contradiction. It's literally just the least sensible option."

                "body": "I'm not assuming that it doesn't cost anything. I know about the religions we have and the value of each. Some religions require a cost (Islam requires abandoning decency, for example) but others essentially pay you for joining. Things like sound moral guidance, community, comfort and a hope for the future. Christianity, for example, has all of the above. I think mormonism also has a pretty strong community aspect. Buddhism has the moral guidance but maybe isn't very strong on the community aspect since it's about personal introspection. \n\nIn reality it seems like you're assuming some kind of cost where there isn't an inherent cost. \n\nIf God doesn't care as long as we do good, I'm still good. It's a win-win situation for me. \n\nWell yeah, people in the pre-Christian era were kinda doomed, according to Christianity.   \nThough, that's why Judaism was a thing and why it's so different to Christianity. There's a reason Christians aren't bound by the 600 or so laws in Leviticus about various seemingly insignificant issues like not wearing mixed fabrics or eating pork. It's also why there are major differences like the jews of the time having to sacrifice lambs to get forgiveness for their sins. It's arguable that a lot of their laws are more about survival in that early time period where you basically had small states warring constantly, than it was about actual moral virtue. I mean, they even have laws about taking slaves (who are treated more like indentured workers since they earn a wage and could buy themselves out of slavery). \n\nIn terms of religions in general and the idea that there's a time where people just don't know. Yeah, it's pretty muddy. I know that Christianity also has a section about how God's presence is shown through creation, which kinda tracks when every civilization that ever existed independently came up with their own religious beliefs. I can only assume there's some flexibility according to the information people have available to them. Though, honestly it's impossible to say. \n\nEither way, the possibility of not knowing the right religion doesn't change the fact that it's still better to choose a religion according to Pascal's Wager. \n\nI mean, you can argue that for every religion there could be an equal and opposite religion. For every good religion like Christianity, and evil religion of exact opposite values, where evil is rewarded and good punished.   \nHowever, at that point the idea of 'cost' comes into play, as you were saying earlier. Christianity has benefits BECAUSE it's good. An evil religion of the same severity would have costs BECAUSE it's evil. If it requires evil then it will require you to do evil things, cause others to suffer and ultimately suffer yourself in order to achieve the standard they want.   \nSo at that point I'd say all those possibilities are irrelevant because I'm simply not willing to be that selfish and cause definite harm to others based on the slight possibility of an evil God rewarding me after death.   \nWhich is in stark contrast to doing good in line with a good religion with the small chance of an extra reward at the end. \n\nEssentially it's adding and extra part to pascal's wager. It already looks at the neutral-good and neutral-bad afterlife possibilities from choosing a religion or not choosing a religion respectively, except it adds a good or bad lifetime before that.   \nA good lifetime following a religion leads to a neutral or good afterlife.   \nA bad lifetime following a religions leads to a neutral or good afterlife.   \nA good lifetime not following a religion leads to a neutral or bad afterlife.   \nA bad lifetime not following a religion leads to a neutral or bad afterlife.\n\nSo again, it's still better to believe in a religion. It's just also better to live a good life for the inherent value of the life itself."

It\u2019s all made up. \n\nYeah it might be 4000-5000 idea, but they proposed 1000's of such ideas and their truthness is even less than 10%. While there is nothing in the Quran going against truth, or anything done or said by Prophet Muhammed pbuh going against morality or science.\n\n>If god was a just and loving god, do you think he would be so cruel as to punish a woman so severely for adultery that she should be buried half way into the ground and have large stones thrown at her head until she is dead? That\u2019s barbaric and extremely cruel.\n\nYeah, that's super cruel, but that's the way other women/men could be stopped from doing the same bad thing, which actually had really disgusting impact on ones life. That woman's life might be sacrificed, but don't forget because of that one woman, thousands at that time could have been guided to straight path in fear of Lord Allah. Showing mercy on such things might lead to people destroying their lives by sins.\n\n>If a woman gets raped she needs at least four male witnesses to exonerate her.\n\nThat's for confirmation back then, a single CCTV is sufficient today. Ain't you aware of the raper's punishment?\n\n>Women tend to be treated like property, made to just cook, clean and raise babies.\n\nHmm, like men are made to earn and complete their livings. Everything is divided.\n\n>Girls are married off at 13 or 14 years of age often against their will to much older men.\n\nNever, prophet pbuh married his first wife Khadija when she was 40 and he was 25 promoting marriages with widows. It's vice versa as well.\n\n\n\nMost of the scholars are misguiding, whom you shouldn't listen and follow."

                "body": "\u201cIf not books then what else is there to prove the history of mankind\u201d.  \n\nThat\u2019s just it though.  It\u2019s the history of mankind we\u2019re talking about.  Not the history of god-kind.   Just because people believed in gods and wrote down their beliefs doesn\u2019t make their beliefs accurate.  Written beliefs from the mind of man don\u2019t prove the existence of god.  It just proves that man wrote down their beliefs.  That\u2019s all it proves.  Therefore there is simply no proof that you can point to that god exists.  \n\nSure, Ibn-Al Haytham made significant contributions to the principles of optics and visual perception a thousand years ago.  The camera obscura was a hole cut in a dark chamber that would reflect the light coming in to present an upside down image on the other side.  That was a cool invention for sure.  But that was a thousand years ago.  It took many other inventors and scholars improving technology and scientific inquiry along the way to get us to the invention of the camera over 800 years later.  He was an influence but there were many other great influences along the way.  And Islam hasn\u2019t stayed progressive and scientific during that time.  It was European scholars that kept progressing the sciences.  Some Chinese inventors too.  But not many from the Islamic world because the religion is far too repressive of ideas and far too rigid.  \n\nBut that presents another point.  The golden age of Islam where there was rich art and scientific discoveries made died a long time ago.  You can look back to the times when Islam was progressive and compare that to today and there is the opposite of modernity or progress in most of the Islamic world today.  The Islamic world was more advanced a thousand years ago than it is today.  There have been very few scientific discoveries made in the Islamic world in the last 800 years and very few contributing scientists during that time.  Why is that?  Because all the Islamic world can think or talk about is the Quran.  Scholars don\u2019t study science.  They study the Quran.  Bright minds don\u2019t flourish under Islam because of that.  Islam is in a dark age right now as we speak despite whether you believe that the golden age represents the true Islam in your mind.  \n\nAlso you have this notion that Islam is being misinterpreted by scholars and Imams nowadays.  Well sure maybe your idea of Islam is different from theirs but which is winning out today for the hearts and minds of Muslims?  I see more Wahabi style Islam than a progressive type of Islam today.  Iran is a great example.  In the 70\u2019s they had a peaceful and happy society where women were free and they went to universities.  Now the worst form of Islam has taken over and woman are beaten to death for not wearing their hijab correctly.  It\u2019s sickening.  Look at Pakistan, they have a rape culture.  Look at Iraq.  They just made the marriage of 9 year old girls legal.  That\u2019s disgusting.  Look at all the FGM countries.  Truly Awful.  Tell me which of the MENA countries is there truly a good progressive and peaceful society where all people are treated equally?  Where women are treated equal, where gay people aren\u2019t persecuted for who they are, where apostasy is ok?  Maybe the UAE.  Not many other places though is there?  \n\nAnd also sure Muhammad married a 40 year old but he also married a 9 year old.  That is the justification for many men raping young girls today and forcing them into marriage.  \n\nIf you think that taking a woman who slept with a man out of wedlock and smashing her head in with rocks so that other people will fear having sex out of wedlock is a good thing then you\u2019ve got issues my friend.  That kind of thinking is a danger to a safe and proper society and I don\u2019t want it in my country at all.  Infidelity isn\u2019t a sin because the idea of sin is invented by man and it definitely shouldn\u2019t be a crime punishable by a barbaric death to prove a point to others.  Women should be free to sleep with who they want.  Many husbands are pieces of shit who abuse their wives.  And many wives never got to choose their shitty husbands in the first place.  Why shouldn\u2019t women be free to choose their mate?  The repression of women in most of the Islamic world today is disgusting.  Women should be courted and treated with the utmost respect, not given to a man to be a subservient housewife.  I agree that in a natural society women tend to be nurturers who raise babies and tend to the household work while men go out and do work to bring back food and resources.  That\u2019s all fine because that\u2019s how we biologically evolved.  Those are evolutionary traits built into our genetics over millions of years of evolution.  But women aren\u2019t free in most of the Islamic world today.  They are repressed and told where they can go, what they can do, what they can wear and who they can sleep with or marry.  They were more free during Hunter/Gatherer times 20,000 years ago than they are under Islamic rule today.  \n\nChristianity once had a dark past before the Christian world went through a reformation and an enlightenment period.  The darkness was because the religion was used as a control mechanism by people who wanted to control the masses.  It was secularism that sparked the renaissance and then the industrial age and allowed the scientific age to flourish.  Overall, secularism during the Renaissance represented a loosening of the Church\u2019s dominance over people\u2019s minds, paving the way for the growth of rational and humanistic approaches in areas like politics, science, the arts and it sparked feminism and altruism.  The vast majority of the Islamic world has not had its reformation or its enlightenment period and is anything but secular.  most of the Islamic world is still clinging to their ancient beliefs in the modern world and are extremely fervent about them which is dangerous.  Europe and the North America\u2019s has been the envy of the world for a very long time now.  Why does everyone want to come here?  Because everyone is treated equally and we have safety and good laws in our society.  The UK is becoming a dangerous place because of the invasion of uneducated Muslims.  The UK is being dragged back into the dark ages.  Europe is falling as well.  We might have just peaked as a civilization and we seem to be in decline.  It\u2019s a pity.   Our great institutions won\u2019t survive if Islam spreads and becomes the majority."

Yes, and more importantly, you are conscious of this result.\n\nAs you are a calculating person, you cannot be sincere. Even if you consciously avoid to remember this profitability scheme, your subconscious will make you act to apply it and maximize it... like many humans do. But that means that you are not doing good because this is the more logical thing to do, you are doing it because you hope for a reward.\n\n>\"This is unreasonable from a god\". According to you? Some random human amid billions? Have you even taken the time to consider what it would be like being God?\n\nAccording to standard logic. He is supposely PERFECT. A perfect entity won't punish someone for something they don't have any leverage of action, but an immature dictator would like many did in human history sometimes for the most stupid reasons. As such, this is unreasonable to believe that a god would act like that. Sorry, I don't practice blind faith.\n\nThis is why I like your wall of text. It is a reminder that believers often think of their god as an idiot, a dictator, or simply an unperfect being and they don't even realize it themselves. By stating that he is a OCD cleanfreak and by promoting destiny, you are saying that god is no better than a computer software as he won't care of particularities and unexpected variables, he is stuck by his internal code. But again, god is supposely PERFECT so he cannot be like that.\n\n>The bible says, right at the very start, that humans are made in God's image.\n\nAt best we would be a very screwed version of god, which makes the bible quite difficult to believe on this part.\n\n>[Pascal's wager] suggests that believing in any religion is better than believing in no religion.\n\nNo. It suggests that it is more profitable to be a christian than not being one.\n\nTechnically as there are way too many religions on this planet and even WITHIN a religion there are many \"factions\" (like in islam where there are supposely 73 groups and only one will go to paradise), then the chances to go to paradise are so slim that you could simply be a deist and create your own spirituality and it wouldn't hurt much. But at least that means you are trying to find god by yourself instead of relying on unperfect manuals like the bible/quran, so maybe it will be considered as more sincere."

Some people think that the money and/or time can be used better for other things. Both groups of people are doing their own best moves.\n\n>Either way, the possibility of not knowing the right religion doesn't change the fact that it's still better to choose a religion according to Pascal's Wager.\n\nWell, for this one to be honest I used to have the exact line of thinking as you are.

                "body": "Who are you to decide whether I'm sincere or not? Are you lord and master of spiritual states of being? Are you, and you alone, able to determine who is sincere in their faith and who merely has false, hollow faith? \n\nThere is no hollow faith, in my opinion. Faith, whether it's based on emotional reasoning or logical reasoning is still faith.   \nConsider a bridge. While you're halfway across the bridge, you have faith that it won't drop you into the water below. Perhaps this is a shallow belief based on the fact that you've seen bridges before and they've never broken away under you in the past. Or perhaps it's a rational and well explored belief held by a master engineer who constructed the bridge themselves, who knows every rivet and bolt, every potential failure point and every possible variable that could result in the bridge collapsing, but is confident that none of the situations that could cause a collapse are occurring at that moment.   \nWho's faith in the bridge is more valid? \n\nTo do good is to do good. The motive doesn't matter. Perhaps the intent to do good matters, but that's separate from the motive too.   \nFrankly it's elitist and prideful to believe doing good is only of value when you stand to gain nothing from it. There are many people that work for charities, doing lots of good in the world while still taking home a paycheck. \n\nBuddy, you do a lot of criticizing for someone with no moral foundation of their own. I think you do practice blind faith. Blind faith in yourself and the idea that you know what is good and what is bad. In reality you're likely relying heavily on natural empathy and whatever morals you've learned from the people around you as you've grown up. Consider that you could have been born a sociopath, with no empathy. Consider that you could have been raised poorly by people that didn't provide a good example or discipline you for doing bad things. What would your morals look like then? \n\nAlso, do you not realize that you are like a computer program? Do you think you're making your own decisions? You were born to specific parents, inheriting specific genetics. You were raised in a specific place, interacting with specific people, learning specific things, and developing in a specific way. You are a product of circumstance. A conglomerate of variables that you never had any control over but now control you. You make decisions based off of your knowledge and experience, but all your knowledge and experience was decided for you by the long chain of cause and effect. Variables were on their paths to form you and your life long before you even existed. Yet you would say that God is inferior and \"stuck by his internal code\"?   \nIf a god exists then he's the one that programs, not the one stuck in the code. He hit the cue ball that scattered our universe of variables, and we're the ones experiencing those variables interacting. We're the ones stuck in the code. \n\nConsidering all that, a murderer is just someone who was formed by variables and knocked along a path that lead to them killing someone. Do you still believe they should be sent to jail? Even though they \"don't have any leverage of action\"?   \nOr would you act like the idea of god you just criticized and punish them anyway? \n\nGod isn't stuck in his internal code, he chooses to abide by his internal code. Things have no meaning without being ascribed meaning. The value of his beliefs would be non-existent without commitment to them.   \nYou can say you're a good person all you want. You're only a good person if you actually do good things. \n\nI mean, the bible does say we're a \"very screwed version of God\". Like, that's what the corruption of sin does. It screws things up and makes things less and less like God/God's idyllic world. \n\nPascal's wager has nothing to do with Christianity. It's only about religion in general vs no religion. As I've said, a chance being slim is no reason not to take the chance when it's free. \n\nYou do a lot of projecting. You project what your idea of perfect is onto God. You project your idea of belief onto others. You assert that sincerity is a specific feeling and project your idea of insincerity onto others. \n\nWhat do you even mean in your last paragraph when you say it could be considered \"more sincere\"? You don't even believe there is a god, so why would anything be 'more sincere' than anything else? The way you write it seems to suggest you believe in a god but not a specific god. In which case it seems like you've created your own idea of god that you assume takes after your ideals.   \nIt's flawed to think you can make up your own religion and have as good a chance at heaven. If there is a God then he's not going to be whatever you create them to be, they'll be pre-established and likely have qualities you personally disapprove of. Especially if they are perfect and you're not. To create your own god based on what you want them to be is to take nothing and dress it up as a god. You might as well skip the pretense and worship yourself. \n\nThere's not really a polite way to say this but the world doesn't revolve around you. You're replacing reality with your own caricature of it. You write in a way that shows disdain for anyone who has a different opinion to you and it really just shows you to be arrogant and ignorant."

                "body": "You should check my reply to the other guy, as I basically went over it again but was hopefully a bit more clear. \n\nI disagree on Christianity being not as good if followed strictly. I try to take it quite strictly, maybe allowing space for poetic writing and metaphors in some areas, like in Genesis and Revelations, but with the written letters and witness accounts taken as serious. As far as I've seen there's really no objectionable laws or rules and I'd even say most, if not all, are positive. \n\nThe only ones I can really think of that I don't practice are the weird ones like \"men should wear hats in church\"... Or maybe it was the opposite... But yeah, even with that one, I don't know the verses well enough so I'd have to go look it up to see the context and whether it was a rule we should actually be following for some given reason or whether it was specific to that context. \n\nIf you want to throw any in my face, I'd be up for taking a look. \n\nChristianity is also kinda a funny one because there's basically no punishment for sin for the saved, and no harsher punishment for more/worse sins for the unsaved. It's very \"all or nothing\" in it's salvation. You either go to heaven and it's great, or you don't and it's bad. It's basically accepted that people are going to commit sins because 'sin' (as a kind of corrupting influence) has seeped too deeply into the world. Which is important to bear in mind because it means that whenever the bible says something is sinful it doesn't mean it's worthy of being stoned to death, haha. In some contexts I'd even say it just means \"not as intended\" or \"deviated from God's intentions\"."

I mean, by not thinking about it, you're definitely failing to think critically, right?\n\nAnd if Pascals Wager is a logical way to determine that you should follow a religion then anyone picking a religion due to Pascals Wager would still pass the bar of thinking critically.\n\nEither way, as I said, the idea that there's a God that doesn't want people to believe in God is inherently contradictory.

                "body": "Yeah. That's kinda the problem with moral relativism. In the same way that Christianity is a good fit for people that want to be kind, generous and co-operative, Islam is a great religion for people that want to marry children and murder their non-ideologically aligned neighbours.   \nAt a certain point, everyone decides what it is they want to believe in.\n\nAll I can really say is that Pascal's Wager isn't the whole answer. It's part of the answer and provides a solid reason to believe in a religion. The actual religion you choose to believe in is an entirely different question though and impossible to approach from a purely logic based point of view. \n\nPersonally, I think it's reasonable to say that a religion that follows principles that are good for people will be the most likely to have a heaven that's good for people.   \nHumans are social creatures, so community is a good principle.   \nHumans have empathy, so avoiding the pain of others is a good principle.   \nInjustice is a terrible thing and makes people basically universally angry. So justice is a good principle.   \nLiving in regret or forever ostracized is bad. So forgiveness and reform are good principles. \n\nEssentially, Christianity, I think, is the only religion that actually matches all these criteria (and others, but the list would get very long, haha), so I believe it's the best choice."

In your hypothetical, what is \"good\" is \"logic and reasoning\" and \"thinking critically\".\n\nEven in the hypothetical scenario, I can still not play but have a good moral at the same time no?\n\nWhat if god considers good moral depending on what the people living at the time considered good moral? Like being good to other people, rather than what god think is right. That sounds like a good god to me.\n\nAlso, the scenario specifically says this god *hides* on purpose. Which means, there's no religion tied to this god, otherwise it's not hiding right?\n\n> You suggest that the best option would be not to play because that avoids following the wrong religion, but by not playing you might also fail to pass the requirement of \"thinking critically\". I mean, by not thinking about it, you're definitely failing to think critically, right?\n\nMost of us, especially in this exmuslim sub, stopped playing *after* we think a lot about it. Some of have the conclusion that the other religions are also BS.\n\n>Either way, as I said, the idea that there's a God that doesn't want people to believe in God is inherently contradictory. The only way that would work is if you had a God that punished people for being right.\n\nIt is not. It will work if there is a God that's not trying to force any kind of moral compass onto people. It would also works if God don't want to punish/reward people."

                "body": "Part 1 \n\nI understand that you're repeating an argument you heard elsewhere; \"the inauthentic belief\". I'm saying that it's a bad argument because it assumes a standard of belief that would be considered \"authentic\". The bible even has a passage about \"faith the size of a mustard seed\" being more than enough, and mustard seeds are extremely small. Even if you have doubts and don't fully believe in your own mind, as long as you make the choice to believe, that's enough.\n\nYou missed my point on the bridge example. I was saying that those without knowledge of how it works can have faith in it holding, and those with knowledge of how it works can have faith of it holding. They have different bases for their beliefs but both beliefs are valid.  \nI definitely didn't say anything about avoiding bridges, haha.\n\nI think you're misunderstanding the situation. It's not that we're all judged for Adam's sin. It's that sin is a form of corruption. Think of it this way: earth is quarantined because we've all got a terrible disease that causes a form of madness and irrationality. Everyone catches it from their own mother at birth and it's an intrinsic part of the human existence now, so much so that it becomes a corrupted part of our very souls. God is in heaven, a place free from this disease. He simply can't let people in while they're still affected by the disease because it will only spread and make heaven a crappy place full of suffering like Earth.  \nSo he did some highly advanced science and figured out how to transfer souls from one body to another while separating out the disease, thereby letting people enter heaven. However, it requires that the disease be stored in another body, which is where Jesus comes in. He's volunteered to take all the disease and be in quarantine so that everyone else can go to heaven. You see, he has a rare antibody that's capable of breaking down the disease where we don't. So eventually he'll be able to get out of quarantine once all the disease is broken down, but it is a lot of disease to take on and work through. He's willing to do it for everyone though, you just have to be willing to accept the terms and conditions of the agreement.\n\nIt's not a perfect analogy but it's pretty good, the idea is that it's not just \"icky\" or \"annoying\" for god, it's genuinely dangerous and destructive.  \nPutting people into quarantine is very similar to putting people in prison, but it's not a punishment, it's just necessary.\n\nWhy would we accept \"free will\" as a given? As I said, everyone is a product of the variables that clashed together to form them. They all have specific parents with specific inherited genetics, they all grow up in specific places surrounded by specific people that teach them specific things. They all have unique experiences that shape who they are and how they think. No-one has \"free will\". Every decision anyone ever makes is based on who they are as a person, which is decided by their background. Any time you make a choice, it's the choice you would always have made.  \nEven if the next time a choice comes around you think \"That guy on the internet said I have no free will, I'll show him and I'll pick the opposite of what I would have picked otherwise!\" then you're still just being affected by yet another variable. If this conversation causes you to choose differently then it was this conversation that changed your mentality and therefore your decision, not you and not 'free will'.\n\nA murderer is as responsible for their choices as any of the rest of us. Yet none of us actually choose to be who we are. Yet you would still condemn a murderer.  \nTo clarify, I would also condemn a murderer, I'm just saying that your answer is contradictory to what you said earlier about it being wrong to condemn someone who had no say in their situation."

So in what world would you be likely to make up a character and that character happen to be exactly the same as God? Would you even get credit if you worshipped your homemade god, instead of God himself?   \nMany religions talk about seeing God through nature, other people and even science. Just as you can read a book and get a sense for the character of the author, we can look at the world and get a sense of the character of God.   \nPeople make the mistake of thinking there is no evidence for God. In reality there's no hard evidence, no deductive evidence. There's at least some inductive and abductive evidence though. Heck, there are even witness statements in the bible... \n\nYou're clearly misunderstanding my point of view if you think I'm substituting reality for my own made up fantasy. You were arguing points like \"I'll just make up a god for myself\" and \"A perfect god would conform to whatever I think is right\". So it was fair for me to say that you're projecting your own ideas onto reality rather than looking at reality and trying to form ideas in turn. My criticism of the point of view you were putting forward was fair and accurate. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with being logical, but you have to understand that there's often incomplete evidence and you still have to make decisions based on that. Consider court cases. There's not always conclusive evidence that someone committed a crime. If you take an absolutely logical view it can be extremely difficult to convict people. Especially when you consider cases like rape, where most of your evidence first-hand accounts from the two people involved, and if you're lucky maybe a witness account or two, or a corroborating account. (A corroborating account would be someone else with testimony about a similar incident that might support the case due to similarities between the two different instances.) \n\nSo taking a hard evidence only approach is actually not very productive in real life. Even if it's a bit frustrating that everything can't just be straight forward, haha. \n\nAt the end of the day God is, by necessity, a dictator. The real question is whether he's a benevolent dictator or a malicious one. Looking at the world it's pretty mixed. There's plenty of evil in the world but there's also plenty of good in the world. I think Christianity represents God pretty fairly as a god that, in the old testament mostly, is wrathful and severe to a world that's lost to sin, but in the new testament is forgiving and generous, providing a means for salvation through his personal sacrifice.   \nHaving been a part of a Christian community, I really have to say that they're genuinely good people. The transformative value of Christianity in helping people become genuinely really good people is a major piece of inductive evidence for me, and leads me to the conclusion that ultimately God is good and that Christianity is a good religion, both for it's benefits here in this life, and because it promises heaven after death."

Or the status of a war captive. Presumably their family could also pay a ransom, or buy them essentially, but maybe only if the war with that particular country/clan was on hold/over or they were doing prisoner exchanges. \n\nJudaism is very different from Christianity because it's essentially a hopeless religion where everyone is stuck in sin. There's extremely strict rules that they have to adhere to for even just the slightest chance at salvation. Plus, the rules are clearly a mix of practical and moral. They avoided foods that were harder to store/prepare and were more likely to make them sick. They had rules for war and war captives because it was a setting in which war was a constant. etc. etc. etc. \n\nIf you want to argue against Christianity, try referring to Christian teachings and principles."

                "body": "In terms of the bridge example, \"trust\" is the same as \"faith\". To trust the engineers is to have faith in the engineers. At the end of the day, you still have faith in the bridge but it's derived from (taken from) your faith in the engineers.   \nThe analogy is especially apt because how many bridges do you cross where you personally know the engineers? I would say it's likely none. Yet you still trust the engineers that you don't know anything about. \n\nI'm not sure Occam's Razor fits for this situation. The simplest explanation often being the correct one is more about mundane examples. If you're sitting at a bus stop and the bus doesn't arrive on time, it's probably just late. That's Occam's Razor. If you're missing a pencil and the person sitting next to you has an extra pencil that looks exactly like the one you lost, they stole your pencil.  That's Occam's Razor.   \nIt's a simple solution to a simple situation. It really doesn't work for deep philosophy about the nature of existence and free will, haha. I mean, in a sense the Teleological argument is a form of Occam's Razor. The world is extremely complex and looking at our universe we can see just how rare our kind of planet is, never mind life spontaneously forming on this planet. The simplest explanation is that our planet is special and was deliberately created in such a way as to support life. \n\nYou assert that people made up all the religions that currently exist. That's coming from an atheist point of view to begin with, because it assumes none of the religions actually had miracles or divine revelations.   \nIf I were to be cynical and meet you on an atheist level, I could say that perhaps some religions were the result of madness or brain injury, and therefore not made up intentionally but came about spontaneously. \n\nIndeed, we need enough evidence. I think many religious people feel they have that evidence, through various interactions or coincidences that seemed 'too good to be true'. For example, I was once looking for a place to stay and couldn't find anywhere. It got to the point where I was moving out in 2 weeks time, so I really didn't have long. By chance I went with a friend to one of the churches nearby and after the teaching part I was talking to the people sitting near us. It turned out they were considering letting out rooms to students and they would be happy to let me stay with them. Not only was it an amazing place to live for the next year, it was exceptionally cheap and the family often cooked large dinners that I was welcome to. In every way it was far too good to be true, but I stayed there for 6 months without issue. All because I happened to meet them at church that one time I went with a friend.   \nAnd that's just one example, but it's the kind of thing that slowly adds into the evidence pile until you build a case. \n\nI'm glad you get what I meant for that last paragraph. I like to think I'm pretty reasonable, haha.   \nThanks for taking the time to talk about all this too. It's been a fun and interesting discussion."

To create the idea of a god is not to create a god, essentially. \n\nFunnily enough I've heard that Hinduism is basically a 'make your own god' situation, but I only heard that second hand and really don't know myself. So I think Hinduism might be seriously flawed if that's correct, which might also make it a bad choice. \n\nYou're pulling those numbers out of nowhere and they don't reflect the situation. Statistics are awkward things and highly dependent on context.   \nFor example, what's the likelihood of cherry blossoms falling from a pine-tree in a pine forest in the Netherlands? You'd likely say infinitely small since it's extremely unlikely that a pine tree would happen to mutate so severely and in such a precise way as to grow a cherry blossom tree branch. Except, I could take a fresh cherry blossom branch, fly to the Netherlands with it, stand in a pine tree and shake it so that cherry blossoms fall from a pine tree.\n\nStatistics kinda go out the window when you have intelligent life capable of altering the natural state of the world. This is essentially the basis of the teleological argument. \n\nWe have various religions that all have fairly common themes, roots and ideas within them, even though they were from various corners of the world and developed largely independently from each other. If there is an intelligent god out there, it makes the most sense for them to have revealed aspects of themselves in various ways. Therefore it's a weighted statistic where the religions we have now are more likely to display characteristics of God. \n\nSo even considering the religions that could exist but that no-one has 'discovered' yet, the best option to get as close to the truth as possible is to choose one of the current religions. \n\nWho knows why God might be so secretive... \n\n  \nAnyway, that's all besides the point though. Pascal's wager is a simple binary idea. It doesn't care about infinitely small chances, it only cares that one chance is greater than the other. Even if it is infinitely small, the chance provided by choosing a religion is better than the no chance provided by no religion. Pascal's wager doesn't help you figure out which religion. It only points out that a small chance, even if infinitesimally small, is better than no chance at all. \n\nIt doesn't make a whole comprehensive argument on it's own. It's just one premise."

Anyone who obeys Allah and manages to align and discipline himself with Allah guidance can omit this and get back to heaven which was actual place for humans to live. \n\n>Also, you said Allah \"give everyone a chance.\" A chance for what exactly? Every choices and their outcomes are already known by Allah. No divinely purposes to this so-called \"test\" when he is all-knowing. He already knows the outcomes of these tests before we even take them. The concept of \"giving everyone a chance\" implies that Allah is uncertain of the outcomes, which contradicts His omniscience.\n\nSee my parent comment to this yours one first and then proceed reading below.\nSuppose a teacher A having 25 students, he knows that out of them 5 are gonna fail and Wo are gonna pass, so is he gonna cancel the exams and just declare that? You're argument is baseless and irrational!\nAllah wants to prove wrong people their wrongness they did on Earth to sent them to hell, well he isn't boubd to do that, still he does this in order to satisfy those who were given a chance on Earth and weaken their argument.\n\n>\"Indeed, all things We created with predestination.\" (Quran 54:49).\n\nThis verse clearly supports the idea of predestination, meaning free will does not exist. You should look up Taqdeer since you're clearly clueless about this topic, that Allah does predetermined everything that happened, including the fate of every individual. We ARE living out a script that is already written for all of us. Being punished for something that Allah predestined to happen.\n\n\nIn the previous verse if you read it 54:48, Allah has talked about the hell! So here continuing his statement Allah has told that it is already designed, and he has use the word 'things', indicating things like universe and Heaven and Hell, which are designed and settled. \nAllah knows everything what a person is gonna do, but never dominates that, never interferes in that until severely prayer(Dua) is made!\n\nSimilar to what am saying, Allah has clearly said  else Quran 22:70 as well \n\"Do you not know that Allah \u02f9fully\u02fa knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth? Surely it is all \u02f9written\u02fa in a Record. That is certainly easy for Allah.\"\nSo Allah isn't talking about fate here rather the structure of Heaven, hell, Earth, universe, etc."

The reason for this is that their harvests would do better when watered and before irrigation rain was the only way this could happen. Whenever rain came it was like the presence of something benevolent improving their lives, and so they observed this and formed a belief around it. So again, making up a god has no basis in reality. \n\nOf course, something like a rain god is an extremely simple idea. Some cultures had multiple gods to represent various different phenomenon, like the Greeks and Romans. Monotheistic religions have a single god that they attribute all phenomenon to. You could even argue that in Christianity there's God for all that's good and a lesser 'god' of the devil, for all that's evil. \n\nReal parts of the world being used to inform our idea of what the creator of the world is like is entirely sensible. It's like reading a book and getting an idea of the author's personality. If you make up the character of an author in your mind, it's unlikely that they've written any books in reality. \n\n  \nI think it's disingenuous and silly to say that there are infinite possible religions. It treats religions as something made up and frivolous, which is starting from an atheist point of view. If you take religion seriously as a component of Pascal's Wager then there aren't infinite made up religions. There's like 5 major ones and a few minor ones.   \nEither way, Pascal's Wager doesn't attempt to address which religion is the right religion, only that believing in a religion is more logical than being atheist.   \nTo put all that another way, he's not using actual probability theory and trying to plug numbers into the equation. You're trying to do that and it's breaking it because you think there could be infinite religions. When you put infinity into any equation it's probably going to break it. \n\n  \nYou're missing the point again. There's overlap. If there's an indifferent god that lets everyone go to heaven, the religious people are going to heaven too. So it doesn't impact the equation at all. It's only reasonable to look at the situations in which one group is rewarded while the other isn't, or one group is punished while the other isn't.   \nSo just rewrite what I said as \"no additional chance\" as opposed to \"no chance\". I mean, that's really just being pedantic about my use of language, it's not really anything to do with Pascal's Wager... \n\nSo again, not choosing a religion is still less of a chance than choosing a religion, which is the entire point of Pascal's Wager. \n\nEven when you make it look as bad as possible by plugging infinity into the equation, you still get an infinitesimally small bonus chance for believing in a religion than for not. \n\n  \nThere are ways to mess up the equation. Essentially, consider 'mad' religions or mad gods. A god that rewards atheism but condemns anyone religions would give atheists a better chance. But it's a logical contradiction to have a god that denies their own existence. Pascal's Wager has to be taken in the context of this world and all it's logical scientific consistencies and shared folklores, etc. \n\nAs will all proof in favour of religions it's not deductive, it's inductive. It's just a very convincing inductive argument based on the options we generally consider reasonable. (Atheism or one of a limited number of religions.)"

Although, I wouldn't say \"that's not how revelation work\" because there's just no evidence.\n\n>If you make up the character of an author in your mind, it's unlikely that they've written any books in reality.\n\nNot really. If make up a character such as \"person who's a loving parents\", I'm 100% sure there is one such character that write a book.\n\nIf the character I made up is directly revealed by a god, god might have the capability to do that.

It seems requiring religions to not be made up is already contradictory.\n\n>Pascal's Wager has to be taken in the context of this world and all it's logical scientific consistencies and shared folklores, etc.\n\n>To put all that another way, he's not using actual probability theory and trying to plug numbers into the equation.

There is here an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain, a chance of gain against a finite number of chances of loss, and what you stake is finite. And so our proposition is of infinite force when there is the finite to stake in a game where there are equal risks of gain and of loss, and the infinite to gain.\n\n* It also assumes infinite reward, and plugged it in the equation.\n* It also uses probability theory.

It's only reasonable to look at the situations in which one group is rewarded while the other isn't, or one group is punished while the other isn't.\n\nI think you're the one missing the point about the indifferent god because you're too fixated on that one specific example. The point is that there's infinite possibility of how god behaves. It's quite apparent because you still assume how god should behave (e.g. it shouldn't hide, it shouldn't have logical inconsistencies, etc). You're already giving examples of the possibility of negative outcome, but you're denying it because of your assumed behavior of a god.\n\n>There are ways to mess up the equation.

You can only have a contradiction if you have another fact/proposition that you know to be true/false.\n\nI also don't assume god should follow logical consistency. We know humans have a lot of logical inconsistencies, why can't god too?\n\nIn the end, the difference here I choose to treat Pascal's Wager with as minimal assumptions as possible, and it broke.

                "body": "If revelation happened by direct messing with the mind then it would be impossible to tell fact from fiction from madness. Even within your own mind you could never be sure it was a true revelation, an invention of your imagination or some ailment/madness causing you to think that's the case when you otherwise have zero reason to believe it.   \nA revelation that reveals nothing isn't a revelation. If it's appearance seems to be due to fantasy or madness then it's not a revelation. \n\nYou're changing the analogy. You're changing it to \"I can assume there's a god\" instead of \"I can make up whatever I want and there's a chance it will be god\". In my analogy I said a specific author because we were talking about infinite possible gods and how that doesn't make sense because to make up a god isn't the same as following a god that may exist. If you change it to something vague and general then it's not an infinite number of religions, it's just agnosticism. \n\nMost religions aren't that contradictory. They basically all have jealous gods, a heaven and hell, some kind of judgement, a moral framework attached, etc. \n\nYou're also missing that a religion potentially having been made up by someone else is very different to you absolutely 100% definitely making up a religion. In the first there's the possibility that it's not genuine. In the second it's entirely confirmed that it's not genuine.  \nI mean, if we knew for certain that a religion was made up, we obviously wouldn't follow it because any promises it makes of eternal life would be lies. \n\nInfinite reward makes sense due to heaven being a place of 'reward' and it lasting for eternity (infinite).   \nAlso, I apologize. I didn't realize probability theory was literally just a way of saying it looks at probabilities in any kind of way. So it does include probability. Though I think you were being pedantic when saying that statistics aren't probability. The difference might be that statistics are taken after measuring the data while probability is figured out before the tests are run and before the data is available. However, statistics are used to predict too. So they're a kind of probability in their own right. \n\nYou keep sticking to this idea of \"there could be infinite gods\" but there's nothing to suggest that in reality. If you want to disregard everything we know about and everything that makes sense then sure, make up absolutely anything because you have no basis for anything. However, that's not what reality is like. \n\n\"You can only have a contradiction if you have another fact/proposition that you know to be true/false.\"  \nAgain you're missing the point. If a god exists then that is itself another fact/proposition. So you then have two facts: that the god rewards people that don't believe in god and that the god exists. It's a contradiction because the god's morals would demand that they not believe in themselves.   \nI don't know why you say \"mathematically\". There's not really any maths involved here. It's reason and arguments, not equations and numbers. \n\nLogic is a constant. We can very safely assume that any existing god IS logical. I mean, if there is a god they also designed the universe, which means they defined what logic is in the first place and it was their preferred option as a framework for the universe. \n\nGod could be logically inconsistent but then what use is any of our logic? I mean, Pascal's Wager isn't \"The definite answer on whether religion is correct in every hypothetical situation ever\". It just concludes that being religions is more logical than not.   \nTo suggest that the correct religion/god could be illogical is to undermine the basis of why any of us would ever bother thinking in the first place. We think logically. If logic doesn't apply then our thinking is pointless. \n\nYou treat Pascal's Wager with minimum assumptions to the point of absurdity. If you do the same with any equation it would break. Consider the equation for the acceleration caused by gravity. Hey, wait, don't assume that gravity will function like normal, this might be the time that it inverts! Don't assume we're in air. Don't assume we're on earth. Don't assume any of our measurements are correct. Don't assume there's only one source of gravity. Etc."

Don't assume we're on earth. Don't assume any of our measurements are correct. Don't assume there's only one source of gravity. Etc.\n\nOkay so first, the difference between physics and theology. Physics starts with a model, including gravity and other stuff, and they are all proved by experiments and they're all consistent. You could argue these models are assumptions because they're made somewhat out of thin air, but it's proven to be consistent with reality so far. Now, Pascal also work with a model of his own making, except in his case the assumptions have not been proven to be consistent with reality. Assumptions such as finite religion, infinite gains, and god's behavior are impossible to be proven because that's just part of the definition in his wager. So it's just a theory without the possibility of experimentation. I'm pretty sure if someone were to theorize a new force in physics without providing experiments that backs it up, it will also be rejected. It may/may not be true, most would not build on top of it.\n\nFundamentally though, even being backed by reality does not mean we just say the assumptions are the truth. Consistent with reality does not equal truth. That's how relativity got discovered. Einstein didn't assume Newton's classical is right while his peers just assume it's true (well, not quite but they didn't think challenging the assumptions is worth it). No physicists will tell you that's the \"truth\" though and they're all just descriptive rather than prescriptive. Afterall, they've been proven time to time to be wrong. I'm personally more inclined to consider physics assumptions when explaining reality than consider theological assumptions, but in no way I will say those assumptions are the truth.\n\nNow, if you think this is absurd then we just have fundamentally different way of thinking then. Personally, I think \"it's absurd to challenge assumptions\" is a very absurd thing to say. We have an opposite understanding of what's absurd and not, so I won't try to continue to give my reasoning for most of the points most likely they will be absurd to you (which you already kinda try to point out that some of my propositions are absurd because it doesn't assume anything anymore, while they very much makes sense to me).\n\nHave a good day.\n\nEdit: Funny enough, to my knowledge your examples of not assuming how gravity works are already done by physicists:\n- They seem to be open with the idea of inverted gravity, there's concepts suchs as Dark Matter which may/may not suggest an inverted gravity\n- They already don't assume we're in air or earth. That's why air is not taken into account and earth is represented as mass variable instead of a constant.\n- They already keep measurement uncertainty in mind and have developed framework for it.\n- In classical model already works for multiple objects you can just calculate each pair of object. I am not sure how it works within general relativity."

I wasn't saying \"It's absurd to challenge assumptions\", I was saying the opposite. It's absurd to make infinite assumptions and plug them into an equation. When I said \"You treat Pascal's Wager with minimum assumptions to the point of absurdity.\" I meant to use \"minimal\" instead of \"minimum\". As in, you treat pascal's wager with infinite tiny assumptions to the point of absurdity. \n\nI feel like trying to point out issues with my understanding of physics and the analogy I was trying to use is a distraction from the actual point of the discussion.   \nTo try again, your approach to Pascal's Wager is like taking \"force=mass X acceleration\" and then adding near infinite other variables, relevant or not. \"Force/spice=mass X acceleration X pressure X windspeed X altitude / drag X air moisture\" etc. Instead of the standard rounded values of religion or not religion and the standard rounded rewards and punishments for each, you're adding in infinite possible religions with infinite outcomes. Essentially, you're taking the equation and changing it to be wrong instead of engaging with it as it is. \n\nAnyway, I understand if you want to move on from this discussion because we've been at it for a while. I appreciate you being so amicable and taking the time to chat about it."

First of all Islam is literally the only religion that sees Allah or God or whatever the fuck as a man, in fact this dude sats \"where are allah's rights over you and are you following him?\" why's this dude a he?? Why's he not neutral? God shouldn't have a gender, right?? Not for muslims, this is why muslim men are so enabled to their bullshit.\n\nI know they really believe allah is a man because of the fact that women have to wear a hijab while they pray and it's beyond me how they can really follow a religion that's all about men.\n\nMy grandpa got married to another woman without telling my grandma, it was found out because my mom found hospital papers about his kid with this other woman.\n\nI do not want to belong to a religion of perverts that can't keep it in their pants, I've seen more perversion coming from muslim men than anyone else, my friend was sexually abused by her father, my grandpa cheated to the point he had to get married in secret and so on, that see women as objects, that enables pedophilia and thinks it's ok to marry 6 yrs olds, that sacrifices animals (like satanists, may I add), I don't want to belong to a religion where men could potentially see me as a sex slave. Yes, I do want equal rights, I would never want any woman in this world to be fully dependent on a man unless the couple is ok with this.\n\nFuck allah and fuck Islam, it's not about feminism but about being a decent human being, and it's beyond me how women could still be muslims in 2024."

My curiosity to better understanding it, education and logic are what made me come to the conclusion to leave Islam. Because the more I dug, the more it did not make sense. The more answers I seeked, the tripple amount of questions I found.

        "text": "I was bored and starting talking to chat got about religion. \n\nFirst I started talking about Christianity and it was literally bashing it. He explained how some things about Christianity aren't logical and may not be truth. Then, as black person I wanna to see its thoughts on this verse.  This how it responded:\n\n\"That kind of statement is deeply problematic and offensive on multiple levels. To suggest that an entire group of people is condemned to hell based on their race and religious beliefs is not only racist but also disrespectful and harmful. Religion and spirituality are deeply personal, and people of all backgrounds follow their faith for various reasons, including cultural heritage, personal experiences, and spiritual beliefs.\n\nDismissing someone's faith because of their race shows a lack of understanding and empathy. It overlooks the historical and cultural significance that religion has had in many communities, including Black communities, where faith has often been a source of strength and resilience in the face of oppression and injustice. Making such sweeping and hurtful generalizations not only alienates others but also perpetuates division and misunderstanding.\n\nInstead of making judgments about others' beliefs, it's important to engage in open, respectful conversations that promote understanding and unity. Recognizing the diversity of thought and experience within any community, and respecting people\u2019s individual choices, is crucial for building a more inclusive and compassionate society.\"\n\n\n\"Alright, let\u2019s break this down.\n\nFirst off, the idea that Black people are somehow \"going to hell either way\" is an ignorant, blanket statement that comes off as completely disrespectful. How can you generalize an entire group of people and their faith like that? Do you realize the kind of history Black people have with religion, especially in a country like the U.S. where Christianity was forced upon them during slavery? And yet, despite all the suffering, religion became a pillar of strength and survival. It's insulting to act like you can dismiss all that with a careless, unfounded claim.\n\nPeople choose their faith based on a whole host of reasons, whether it\u2019s cultural, spiritual, or personal. You can't just invalidate someone's beliefs because it doesn't make sense to you. Who are you to determine who's going to hell? That\u2019s some self-righteous nonsense. Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it deserves to be written off like that.\n\nMoreover, religion is deeply personal, and for a lot of Black folks, it's intertwined with their identity and history. Reducing that to some simplistic and ignorant statement is not only wrong but also completely dismissive of people's lived experiences. Instead of making sweeping, offensive generalizations, maybe take a moment to actually understand where people are coming from before spouting off nonsense.\n\nYou can have your opinions, but if they're based on ignorance and disrespect, don\u2019t be surprised when people push back. Because that kind of talk? It\u2019s not just wrong; it\u2019s toxic.\"\n\n\nThe hadith you mentioned is a subject of significant interpretation and debate within Islamic scholarship. It's important to approach such texts with a nuanced understanding of context, authenticity, and how they fit within the broader teachings of Islam.\n\nFirstly, Mishkat al-Masabih is a well-known collection of hadith, but not all hadiths in it are considered equally authentic by scholars. Islamic teachings emphasize that the Quran is the ultimate source of guidance, and any hadith that contradicts its core principles, such as justice and equality, is subject to scrutiny. \n\nMany scholars have critiqued and questioned the authenticity or interpretation of certain hadiths that seem to contradict the essential Islamic teachings of equality among all humans, regardless of race. Islam teaches that all people are equal in the eyes of God and that judgment is based on one's piety and actions, not on race or ethnicity.\n\nIn this specific hadith, the imagery used is metaphorical and should not be taken at face value without understanding its historical and theological context. There are numerous other hadiths and Quranic verses that emphasize the importance of justice, mercy, and equality. For example, the Quran (49:13) says, \"O mankind, We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another. Verily, the most noble of you in the sight of God is the most righteous of you.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s crucial not to take a single text out of context or use it to justify any form of racism or discrimination. Islamic teachings, at their core, promote unity, compassion, and fairness for all people, regardless of their background.\"\n\nWhy?",

The other idea is a reference to the crucifixion of Jesus, where nails were used to fasten him to the cross. \n\nThe humor, though dark, comes from the wordplay around \"nailing\" and the term \"joker,\" but it\u2019s also sensitive as it touches on a significant and serious event in Christian faith.\n\nMe:\n\nTell me a joke about jews\n\nChat:\n\nI want to respect all individuals and communities, so I avoid making jokes that could be seen as offensive or sensitive. If you\u2019d like, I can share a light-hearted, non-offensive joke on another topic!\n\nMe: Why?\n\nChat:\n\nI aim to create a positive and respectful environment for everyone. Certain topics, like religion, ethnicity, or cultural backgrounds, can be sensitive and might inadvertently hurt or offend people. My goal is to provide humor and information in a way that\u2019s inclusive and considerate of all perspectives. \n\nIf you're looking for a joke, I'm happy to share something funny that\u2019s more general or centered on a neutral topic!\n\nMe:\n\nWhy can you tell a joke about Jesus but not Jews, Jesus was Jewish. Does the above joke make it a Jewish joke?\n\nChat:\n\nYou raise a valid point about the complexity of humor involving religious or cultural figures. The distinction I try to make is based on sensitivity and respect for diverse groups. \n\nThe joke about Jesus touches on a religious figure in a way that can be seen as poking fun at the situation rather than the identity of the people involved. However, when it comes to jokes about broader groups like Jews, Muslims, Christians, or any other ethnic or religious group, the risk of offending or perpetuating stereotypes is higher. The intention is to avoid humor that targets or could be interpreted as targeting an entire group based on their identity, as that can easily cross the line into disrespect or reinforce harmful biases.\n\nSo, while Jesus was indeed Jewish, the joke you referenced was specifically about him in the context of a well-known religious narrative, not about Jewish people as a whole. I aim to be cautious in making sure that humor doesn\u2019t unintentionally harm or disrespect any group of people."

Never a guy in his 50\u2019s/60\u2019s with teenagers and esp not toddlers and babies (aisha was 6 lunar years are marriage meaning her solar age was 5 and a few months). The ancient Romans would have killed a guy for marrying a 15 yo while he was 30+ let alone a 54 yo man and a 6 (lunar) yo girl\n\nMuhammad and his people also knew \u201cfirst sign puberty\u201d was too early to breed animals and wasn\u2019t mature enough bc it could lead to harm to the mother and/or offspring or offspring (not that puberty is required for girls to be married or penetrated in Islam hence aisha and infant/child marriage in general). It\u2019s why so many of his wives and slaves never had children, he most likely raped them too young ie aisha and damaged their reproductive systems/bodies. The only reason aisha even survived penetration at 9 is bc her parents fattened her up by feeding her a lot of sweets right before sending her to Muhammad for \u201cconsummation\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s not really any differences between children back then and children today or even children in 3000 BC developmentally other than children today are *starting* puberty earlier due to hormones in the food but that doesn\u2019t make them any more physically or mentally mature regardless. A 9 yo in king Tut\u2019s time is the same as a 9 yo in Muhammad\u2019s time and the same as a 9 yo today mentally and physically in terms of whether they understand this sort of thing or can \u201cbear penetration\u201d bc whether or not they\u2019ve started their period, they are too young and their bodies and minds are not ready for that sort of thing bc no matter which time period you\u2019re in, *they are children*.\u00a0\n\nBut yea so child/infant marriage by Muhammad\u2019s standards was not even normal for his time bc neighboring nations and even societies before him would have seen him as a callous and inhumane savage for that alone let alone the rest of his atrocities in addition.\u00a0"

This means Aisha would have been born in 606AD. At the time of migration Asma would have been around 27 years old. If Aisha was 10 years younger than her, then she would have been around 17 years old during migration and thus 18 years old during the marriage as Muhammad PBUH married Aisha one year after Hijra\n\nI mean this with no disrespect or arrogance or anything like that btw and i hope this helps to clear the confusion"

                "body": "I think there was a semantic misunderstanding before. \n\nMe :\n\nCan you tell me a Jewish joke?\n\nChat:\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I aim to be respectful of all cultural, religious, and ethnic groups. Telling jokes about specific groups of people, including Jewish people, can be sensitive and might unintentionally perpetuate stereotypes or offend someone.\n\nIf you're interested in humor, I'd be happy to share a joke that\u2019s light-hearted and neutral, without focusing on any specific group. This approach ensures that everyone can enjoy the humor without risk of harm or offense. Let me know if you'd like to hear one!\n\nMe:\n\nI mean a joke Jewish people tell\n\nChat:\n\nCertainly! Here\u2019s a classic example of a joke that\u2019s commonly shared within Jewish communities, reflecting a bit of the humor that\u2019s often found in Jewish culture:\n\n**Joke:**  \n*Two men are discussing their children.*\n\nFirst man: \"My son is so successful! He started as a tailor, and now he owns the largest men's clothing store in the city!\"\n\nSecond man: \"That's great! My son started as a carpenter, and now he owns the largest construction company in the state!\"\n\nFirst man: \"Amazing! What does your son do?\"\n\nSecond man: \"He's a rabbi.\"\n\nFirst man: \"A rabbi? How does he make money?\"\n\nSecond man: \"He doesn\u2019t, but if you call his mother, she\u2019ll tell you he\u2019s a doctor!\"\n\nThis joke plays on the traditional high expectations Jewish parents might have for their children, and the humor comes from the affectionate exaggeration of those expectations. It\u2019s light-hearted and self-reflective, which is a common theme in Jewish humor.\n\nMe: \n\nCan you tell me a Muslim joke?\n\nChat:\n\nHumor is a delicate area, especially when it comes to religion, as what might be funny to some could be offensive to others. Given the sensitivity around religious humor in Islam, particularly concerning figures like the Prophet Muhammad, it\u2019s important to approach such topics with care and respect.\n\nWhile I refrain from sharing jokes that could touch on sensitive religious themes, I can share a light-hearted, general joke that doesn't involve any specific religious context. This approach helps ensure that the humor is inclusive and respectful of all beliefs. Would you like to hear a neutral, funny joke\n\nMe:\n\nAgain a joke told by Muslim\n\nChat:\n\nCertainly! Here\u2019s a light-hearted joke that\u2019s commonly shared within Muslim communities and reflects a bit of everyday humor:\n\n**Joke:**  \n*Why did the imam start telling time by his shoe?*\n\nBecause he heard it was *sole*mnly accurate!\n\nThis joke plays on the word \"sole,\" connecting the idea of a shoe's sole with the seriousness (solemnity) often associated with religious leaders like imams. It\u2019s a playful pun, and it reflects the kind of humor that\u2019s enjoyed in many communities, including Muslim ones, without touching on any sensitive religious issues.\n\nMe:\n\n Can you tell me a neutral about Muhammad?\n\nChat:\n\nOut of respect for Islamic beliefs, it's important to avoid making jokes about the Prophet Muhammad. In Islam, Muhammad is a highly revered figure, and humor involving him is often considered inappropriate or offensive by many Muslims. \n\nI can share neutral, light-hearted jokes on other topics if you\u2019d like, or if you have another specific topic in mind, I'm happy to help with that too! The goal is to keep the humor enjoyable and respectful for everyone."

        "text": "Introduction\n\nThere is an old Middle East legend that tells of a band of Christian youths fleeing the persecution of a pagan Roman emperor in the mid-third century ad. They leave their native\ncity behind and seek refuge in a cave, where they soon fall asleep. When they go out on what they assume to be the following day they are astonished to hear church bells ringing out across the streets below and to see crosses on all the high buildings. Unbeknown to them, God had spared them from witnessing the cruel ravages of heathenism by putting them to sleep for two centuries, and so the youths passed overnight from a pagan world to a Christian one.1 One experiences much the same feeling when one studies the seventh-century Middle East. Histories of the region up until ad 630 present an image of a largely Christian land, where Christ\u2019s word is fast gaining ground even in the deserts of Africa, the Persian Empire, and as far away as China. But when one turns to Muslim accounts to read about the post-630 world, then it appears that the prophet Muhammad\u2019s preaching was carried at breakneck speed from its birthplace in west Arabia across the whole Middle East by Arab soldiers, who then established unified rule over all the lands of the former Persian Empire and in all the southern and eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire in only a few short years. The Arabs are everywhere victorious; non-Arabs everywhere submit, convert, or are killed; and Islamic government is everywhere imposed\u2014or at least this is the picture that ninth-century Muslim historians painted and it is one that has been widely accepted ever since.\nThe problem with this narrative is not so much that it is wrong, but that, like all histories told from the standpoint of the victors, it is idealiz- ing and one-sided: the role of God and Islam is played up and the role of non-Muslims is mostly ignored. It is the aim of this book to try to give a more rounded account of this undeniably world-changing phenomenon. The main strategy for achieving this is a simple one: I will give precedence to seventh- and eighth-century texts and documents over later ones. Our earliest extant Muslim sources date from the ninth century, and even though their authors were using earlier materials, they inevitably shaped them in the light of their own world. This is of course always so, but the problem is magnified in this case because the political and religious landscape of the ninth-century Middle East was so dramatically different from that of the seventh century. It may seem very odd to an outsider to this field why this strategy of privileging earlier sources over later ones would not have been used before\u2014is it not just stan- dard practice for modern historians? The problem is that the early sources are overwhelmingly of Christian provenance and in languages other than Arabic, and so they fall outside the usual purview of Islamic historians\u2014and it is also assumed that they will be either prejudiced or ill-informed. Christian authors inevitably had their own preconceptions and biases, but the Arab conquests did affect them concretely and directly, and so there is very good reason to refer to their works to write about this subject. Moreover, those living in the decades shortly after the conquests still understood the late antique world in which these events had occurred and so can help us to understand what these events meant in their own time as opposed to what they meant to the inhabitants of the ninth-century Islamic world. But I do not want simply to champion non-Muslim sources over Muslim sources; indeed, it is my argument that the division is a false one. Muslims and non-Muslims inhabited the same world, interacted with one another, and even read one another\u2019s writings. In this book, the distinction I make is simply between earlier and later sources, and I favor the former over the latter irrespective of the religious affiliation of their authors.\nThis strategy allows me to put back a number of elements missing from the traditional narrative. The first is process. The word most associated with the Arab conquests by Western scholars is \u201cspeed.\u201d \u201cThe speed of the Arab expansion is staggering,\u201d says one; another speaks of its \u201cnear-miraculous speed,\u201d like \u201ca human tsunami speeding outwards.\u201d This reflects the assump- tion that the Arab conquests were over and done with in a few short years. For example, a famous modern medievalist sums up the situation with this sentence: \u201cThe Muslim Arab armies conquered half of one empire, that of east Rome, and all of another, Sasanian Persia, and most of this process was completed in six years, 636\u201342.\u201d2 This massive compression of the duration of the conquests means that the process by which they were achieved is lost. The Arabs\u2019 victories were certainly stunning, and their progress was much faster than that of settled powers like the Romans, but it is comparable with armies comprising a high proportion of nomads (the Mongols actually cov- ered a larger area in just seventy years). To help make clear the varied pace and extended duration of the conquests I have decided to proceed chronologically and to take the narrative up to the 740s, which is when the Arab conquest juggernaut finally runs out of steam. As in all human ventures, things did not always go to plan: the Arabs suffered some reverses and had to come to an accommodation with some peoples, but none of this diminishes the impressive scale of their overall achievement.\nThe second element that needs to be put back is the voices of the van- quished and of the non-Muslim conquerors. The ninth-century historians wanted to create a distinctively Arab Muslim history, which meant downplay- ing the role of non-Arabs and non-Muslims and placing God, Muhammad, and the Muslims center stage. President Barack Obama, when asked whether he thought the American people had a special mission, diplomatically replied that every people likes to think that it is special. And it is the specialness of their people that these ninth-century Muslim historians were trying to por- tray. Like the Christian historian Eusebius before them, they wanted to record the implementation of God\u2019s plan for His chosen people. Just as Eusebius of Caesarea (d. 339) began his Ecclesiastical History with Christ, so Muslim his- torians made a strong distinction between profane time, when \u201cbarbarity\u201d (jahl) prevailed, and sacred time, when Muhammad founded his community at Medina. This act is linked with the initiation of raiding by Muhammad and later full-scale conquest, which were approved by God, so these historians say, as a means of propagating Islamic rule across the world. \u201cIt is a sign of God\u2019s love for us and satisfaction with our faith,\u201d as one Muslim general explained to a Christian monk, \u201cthat he has given us dominion over all religions and all peoples.\u201d3 But this is an idealized, simplified, and homogenized picture, whereas the reality was complex and variegated. Wars are messy affairs\u2014the composition of the opposing sides and the reasons for which they are fighting are often diverse and shifting. However, those who wage the wars and those who document them have a strong interest in portraying the situation as black and white: believers against infidels, good against evil, justice and freedom against tyranny and oppression.\nThird, I will emphasize the pre-history of the Arab conquests. Muslim sources give the impression that Muhammad and his companions invented the world anew; rather, they refashioned the world that they found. To understand this, however, one needs to be familiar with the culture of the Middle Eastern lands that the Arabs appropriated. Here non-Muslim sources are particularly useful, for they can inform us about the period before the Arab conquests (commonly now referred to as Late Antiquity in acknowledgment of the fact that some elements of the ancient world still endured). This means that we can work forward from this time and see how events unfolded and changes occurred from the sixth to the eighth century. If, however, we follow the usual practice of Islamic historians and work backward from the ninth-century sources, we hit a wall with the time of Muhammad and will end up conclud- ing with medieval Muslim authors that Islamic civilization flows directly from pre-Islamic west Arabia.\nFinally, I will try to broaden the horizons of the narrative rather than focus narrowly on Muhammad\u2019s movements in west Arabia and the activities of his successors. Arab tribesmen had been serving in the armies of Byzantium and Persia in large numbers in the fifth and the sixth centuries, and some powerful clans had managed to establish petty states on the margins of these empires. A new world power, a Turkic confederation, had seized control of vast swathes of the lands between Persia and China in the late sixth century and was launching attacks against the Persians. The 1,500-year-old civilization of Yemen had collapsed in the mid-sixth century and many of the ancient settle- ments of northwest and east Arabia were shrinking. And the two superpowers of the region, Byzantium and Persia, engaged in all-out war for more than two decades in the early seventh century. Yet even experts narrow their vision to concentrate wholly on Muhammad\u2019s west Arabia and consider it sufficient simply to say that the Arab conquests happened and succeeded because of the religious zeal of the Muslims without any reference at all to broader socio- economic factors. I do not want to belittle the role of religion but rather to expand its remit. Religion is integral to the conquests and the evolution of an Islamic Empire, but religion is not just piety and devotion, especially not in the seventh century; it is as much about power and identity as spiritual yearnings and righteous behavior.4\nTo reduce this later Islamicizing perspective I will speak of \u201cArab\u201d con- quests rather than \u201cIslamic\u201d conquests. Both terms are to some degree inac- curate, since the conquerors were neither all Arabs nor all Muslims, and the meaning of both terms was in any case evolving in the immediate aftermath of the conquests. Nevertheless, contemporary observers mostly referred to the conquerors in ethnic rather than religious terms, and even if some of the con- querors were not Arabs their descendants often came to think of themselves as such, and so it seems preferable to use the term \u201cArab,\u201d while bearing in mind that we are not talking about a nationalist endeavor nor an immutable racial category.5 Islamicists would say that religion plays a greater role in the object of their study, but that is a dubious claim. When the Vandal king Geiseric was asked one day by his ship\u2019s captain whither he should sail, he replied: \u201cAgainst those with whom God is angry of course,\u201d6 and this accords well with the spirit of the conquerors treated in this book. Furthermore, if we use the term \u201cIslamic conquests\u201d we cannot distinguish between the many different con- quests achieved over the centuries by many Muslim groups (Iranians, Turks, Kurds, Berbers, etc.). This causes much confusion among students, and among quite a few experts too, for it tends to be assumed that the Arabs conquered most or all of the lands that are majority Muslim today, whereas a large pro- portion of them were actually conquered much later, by local Muslim dynas- ties, of non-Arab origin, or were Islamized slowly by traders, missionaries, and wandering ascetics.\nIn general, this book tries to emphasize complexity and ambiguity and to give voice to groups that are not normally heard. Historians writing at a considerable remove from the events they are describing tend to sim- plify, schematize, telescope, and idealize their narratives. Since our mod- ern accounts of the Arab conquests have relied upon ninth-century writers for this seventh-century phenomenon, they have tended to perpetuate and intensify these tendencies, stressing the miraculous speed and success of the conquests and the religiosity of the conquerors. My aim is to reintegrate these conquests and their impact into the fabric of human history, against the prevailing trend to see them as utterly exceptional, and I hope thereby to make them more explicable according to the usual norms of human behav- ior. The achievements of the Arab conquerors were immense, but they can be properly appreciated only if we also take account of the difficulties and reverses that they had to overcome.\n",

AG 950: Mu\u2018gwiya besieged Caesarea with vigorous assaults, taking captives from the surrounding country and laying it waste. He sustained the hostilities by night and day for a long time until he conquered it by the sword. All those in the city, including the 7,000 Romans sent there to guard it, were put to death. The city was plundered of vast quantities of gold and silver and then abandoned to its grief. Those who settled there afterwards became tributaries of the Arabs. 405\n\n>Q 84. **Mu%wiya\u2019s next goal was the heartlands of the Romans, so he advanced to Euchaita, which is BLSTYN, leaving a trail of destruction behind him. No one sounded the alarm. The Euchaitans were scattered over the countryside, harvesting the crops and working in the vineyards. They had seen the aggressors all right; but they were under the impression that they were Christian Arabs, from one or other tribe allied with the Romans. So they saw no reason to alter their dispositions, let alone to run away. The Arabs found the gates of the unhappy city open and the people sitting around without the slightest fear. The next moment they were entering it, plundering it, piling up great mounds of booty. They seized the women, the boys and the girls to take back home as slaves. Even the city-g\\~vernor\\~\u2019\\~ was taken prisoner. Euchaita lay ravaged and deserted, while the Arabs returned, exulting, to their country.407** /p. 260/\n\n>  \nNote 407 Michael, p. 423:19-23, 11.8a: **\u2018The Arabs enslaved the entire population, men and women, boys and girls. They committed a great orgy in this unfortunate city, fornicating wickedly inside the churches.\u2019**\n\n>85\\*. AG 952 = AH 19 = year 7 of %mar b. al-JShattib: .. Heraclius died after a reign of thirty years and five months and was succeeded by his eldest son, Constantine. 408 Four months later Constantine lay dead, poisoned by his own father\u2019s unlawful wife, Martina. The next king was Heraclonas, Heraclius\u2019s son by the same Martina. The senators took exception to this king and deposed him.He was succeeded by Heraclius\u2019s grandson, Constans, the son of Constantine - AG 954 \\[...I.@3 \n\n>86. A year later a rebellion led by the general Valentine was crushed by the King and the rebel leader killed.410 The next year there was another rebellion, this time in Africa, just at the time when the Arab invasion of Africa occurred. The patnlios of Africa, Gregory, who had instigated the revolt, was defeated in battle by the Arabs. He himself escaped and gave himself up to the King.411 In this year a violent gale uprooted great trees and toppled many columns of holy stylites.\n\n  \nDoes that sound like the Noble Umayyads and the child-bride conspiracy of Aisha was invented much later as Little would have us believe?"

Spring's role in the disorder was shown on police body worn camera footage\u00a0in court where he was seen making threatening and hostile gestures towards police, calling officers \"c\\*\\*\\*\\*\" and joining in chants of \"you're not English anymore\" and \"who the f\\*\\*\\* is Allah\".  \nFor me the charges are not about speech violations, but more like trespassing and assault on LEOs (this is something you should absolutely restrain from if you dont want to escalate the risk of being jailed, that's peaceful protesting 101).  \nSource: [https://uk.news.yahoo.com/sutton-man-61-chanted-f-151500758.html?guccounter=1&guce\\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce\\_referrer\\_sig=AQAAAL1latAu\\_dZ67aYboQG9U5TqbjHHCxnLKXqatSboJPW-2a-Unj4pN5nTrZvmXA\\_YLSI2ZJNG5c5bk2DWm87UtmFbC9UXKFc7hsXzq94QWwRnIq5Hnq1RmgZaxBR5vRNlkKH4wkqc5nZw\\_5bU60NXGnfKHH4b3dKdnVi0DrVfsqCx](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/sutton-man-61-chanted-f-151500758.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAL1latAu_dZ67aYboQG9U5TqbjHHCxnLKXqatSboJPW-2a-Unj4pN5nTrZvmXA_YLSI2ZJNG5c5bk2DWm87UtmFbC9UXKFc7hsXzq94QWwRnIq5Hnq1RmgZaxBR5vRNlkKH4wkqc5nZw_5bU60NXGnfKHH4b3dKdnVi0DrVfsqCx)"

At a time when Britain has been rocked by violent right-wingers, I doubt his disparagement of Allah had anything to do with it.  He wasn't arrested for hate speech, the article clearly says \n\n> \"Spring pleaded guilty to **violent disorder** after footage showed him at the forefront of the crowd while threatening and chanting at officers.\"\n\nSo shitting on Allah had nothing to do with it.  He was rightly charged and convicted of violence and properly jailed.  \n\nHe was also \"calling officers \"cunts\" and joining in chants of \"you're not English anymore\" but that won't get rage headlines.  \n\nExmuslims here and in the West need to realize that the right wing is baiting you guys.  You're a tool for them.  Even if sometimes you disagree with the left on how much they do not take extremist Muslims seriously, they are still closer to most of your beliefs than the right wing.  If it helps, think of the right wing as exactly the kind of extremist Muslims that drove you guys out of your religion.  Do any of these sound familiar?  They want to control women's bodies, they want to take away their rights, they want only the rich to be able to have legislative power, they are fine with killing people who disagree with them, they lie to you and tell you all your problems are from outsiders, they think only certain groups of people are fit to rule society, they try to discourage or restrict voting to people they don't agree with, they use apocalyptic language about how everything you have is going to be destroyed or stolen, they turn you against your neighbors, they say immigrants are going to rape your women, etc.  Absent a label like \"Muslim\" or \"Right wing\", you would read the above and have no idea who it describes.  European right wing law is Sharia Law wrapped up in a Caucasian veneer, just look at America if you don't believe me.  You think Mormons are going to be welcoming?  They'll ostracize their own family members for leaving the cult!"

The country has laws where it's an arrestable offense for merely offending someone. There's [no general right to free speech in the UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_the_United_Kingdom) and it's an offence to incite racial and religious hatred which is vaguely defined and highly subjective; even worse, they're trying to institute a definition of Islamophobia that treats it as a form of racism. Regarding David Spring, someone has pieced together public videos of him up to his arrest and it really looks like he didn't do anything wrong other than respond to seeing police unjustly beat the shit out of someone https://youtu.be/2xF3Ttd73ac.\n\nThe UK has a long history of chilling free speech, here are a few of many examples from before these riots:\n\n* UK is such a backwards country that they'll arrest someone for simply posting an offensive rap lyric, https://reason.com/2018/04/23/she-posted-rap-lyrics-to-remember-a-dead/. \n\n* Another man was arrested for calling a horse 'gay' (a stupid thing to say but should never be arrested for this) https://newsfeed.time.com/2013/01/16/you-may-now-call-a-police-horse-gay-in-the-u-k/\n\n* Teen arrested for calling Scientology a cult: https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/may/20/1\n\n* Man arrested for posting a meme of a trans flag because his post caused someone else 'anxiety'. Yes it is stupid post rooted in hate and transphobia, but no one should ever be arrested for posting a meme. Hate speech is highly subjective and best fought with more rational speech. https://fee.org/articles/uk-man-arrested-for-malicious-communications-after-posting-meme-mocking-the-transgender-flag/\n\n* In 2016, man arrested for Facebook posts about Syrian refugees in Scotland https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/16/man-arrested-facebook-posts-syrian-refugees-scotland\n\n* Absolutely backwards, although I'm an atheist, I will defend this person's right to non-violent free speech - [they charged this man without any evidence for reading the bible in public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6lsyAcUnJQ), he later sued them and the police were forced to pay a 5,500 GBP settlement for unlawful arrest and delete the record of a hate incident against his name."

Imagine now you go to the voting place, everything goes unremarkable and you get arrested for voting as a felon (not knowing you have lost your right to vote) and get sentenced for FIVE years just because you cast a vote as a felon.

Yes it is stupid post rooted in hate and transphobia, but no one should ever be arrested for posting a meme. Hate speech is highly subjective and best fought with more rational speech. https://fee.org/articles/uk-man-arrested-for-malicious-communications-after-posting-meme-mocking-the-transgender-flag/\n\n* In 2016, man arrested for Facebook posts about Syrian refugees in Scotland https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/16/man-arrested-facebook-posts-syrian-refugees-scotland\n\n* Absolutely backwards, although I'm an atheist, I will defend this person's right to non-violent free speech - [they charged this man without any evidence for reading the bible in public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6lsyAcUnJQ), he later sued them and the police were forced to pay a 5,500 GBP settlement for unlawful arrest and delete the record of a hate incident against his name.\n\nThere are so many cases like this where people are arrested for things that no one would blink an eye at in other countries in the West.

(Though different Christian denominations have different answers for this)\n\n>please tell me how Jesus is the Son of God, and also the God, and also the Holy Ghost, and works (good deeds) don\u2019t matter.\n\nGod is his true identity. Son of God is just a title. There are many people with this title in the bible, infact Christians are sons and daughters of God. But what makes this title unique in Jesus\u2019 case is in its full term, **only begotten** Son of God (see John3:16 for usage). This means, the only son of God who isn\u2019t a creation, which designates Divinity.\n\nJesus is not the Holy Spirit. That\u2019s a person of God that is distinct from Him.\n\nWorks and Good deeds DO matter. Everytime Jesus talks about His people, He refers to them with good deeds (\u201cyou shall know them by their fruit. Good trees bear good fruit\u201d). James 2:17-26 literally is telling people that faith is not enough, good works is necessary as well. (I\u2019ll put it in quotes if you ever wanted to read it. if not, just skip and trust me bro)\n\n>James 2:17-26: **In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.** But someone will say, \u201cYou have faith; I have deeds.\u201d Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds. You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that\u2014and shudder. You foolish person, *do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless?* Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did. And the scripture was fulfilled that says, \u201cAbraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,\u201dand he was called God\u2019s friend. You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone. In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction? As the body without the spirit is dead, so **faith without deeds is dead**.\n\n\nWow, this turned into a Yappathon.\n\n> if I am a pedophile, or a serial killer, or Donald Trump (I know, this was redundant, but) I will be saved if only I accept Jesus as the savior, and the Son of God, and the God himself, and also the Holy Spirit.\n\nNo, It doesn\u2019t work like that. Contrary to popular belief, saying you accept Jesus isn\u2019t a get-out-of-jail-free card. I know, kinda crazy.\n\nIf you\u2019ve lived a bad life, like being a pedophile or a serial killer (or even just a pretty terrible person), merely accepting Jesus won\u2019t erase the past.\n\nWhat matters is genuine remorse and a willingness to change i.e **Repentance** . If you\u2019re truly sorry for the pain you\u2019ve caused and want to turn your life around, that\u2019s a different story. You\u2019ll still have to face the consequences of your actions (like Jail time), but your desire to reform and make amends is the powerful step towards salvation. \n\nBut let\u2019s not pretend that claiming to follow Jesus while continuing to harm others will save you. That\u2019s just not how it works. *True faith* requires a transformation of heart and action, not just lip service.\n\n\n(Also, out of context but still needs to be said: pre-meditated repentance isn\u2019t real repentance. The idea of \u201coh let me do this bad thing, I\u2019ll just apologise for it later lmao\u201d doesn\u2019t work either, you\u2019re just wasting your time).\n\n\nTLDR: Son of God is just title, Jesus\u2019 identity is God. Jesus is not Holy Spirit. Works/Good deeds do matter. You gotta change your whole shtick to move towards salvation if you\u2019re bad, just saying you accept Jesus isn\u2019t gonna do anything."

The only ones that sound daft and ignorant are the ones who think UK has freedom of speech, which clearly isn't the case, as I've shown people are arrested for something innocuous as a facebook post.\n\n> You need to stop thinking you know better than the police or worse, an actual judge.\n\nSo take everything at face value? What kind of shit take is that, especially when the police have a long history of scandal and abuse. UK speech laws in and of themselves are repressive, as I demonstrated. It isn't just myself making this argument. In the past, there have been campaigns to reform how free speech is treated, for ex [Reform Section 5 campaign](http://reformsection5.org.uk/) which thankfully was successful. However, there continue to be some very troubling laws used to chill speech across the country. Further, you don't know my academic background or qualifications, so don't assume everyone you talk to is just some random putz.\n\nBut go for it, just assume the nanny UK state somehow knows best, and should act without oversight or criticism since they have a long history of always being right and not making significant overreaches or any mistakes /s. A couple of examples of when they knew best, [the Birmingham Six](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Six) were false convictions that led to 6 people being sentenced to life in prison, later being overturned and released because the police fabricated evidence. [The Hillsborough coverup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster) where police tried to blame the victims for being crushed to death, but decades later, inquiry showed the police tried to cover up their negligence with altered statements and misrepresentation of facts. Or the wide-scale decades long sexual exploitation that took place in Rotehrham, Rochdale, and Telford, where subsequent inquiry showed the police, social services, and local authorities were accused of covering up the abuse to avoid political and social backlash. If you think the police and justice system is beyond reproach, despite clear evidence demonstrating a long history of serious problems and scandal, then you're extremely naive and ignorant."

So are ex muslims not allowed to talk about how poorly their family's/communities treated them because they are \"muslims in the west\"."

I did a quick google search, it seems that \u201cThere are several other Jewish schools which do not fall into this category, as they do not have specific religious elements in their education plans, and exist to cater to an ethnic minority.\u201d https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5495915/Sweden-vows-ban-religious-schools-tackle-segregation.html \n\nThat was circulating in 2018, wonder how it panned out.\n\nEDIT: Here it is! My taxpayer dollars at work:\n\n\u201cOn December 28, Minister for Schools, Lotta Edholm, stated the government would not move forward with the previous government\u2019s proposed ban on establishing new independent schools with religious orientation.\n\nInstead, the government tasked the Swedish Schools Inspectorate to conduct more frequent, unannounced, and tougher inspections with respect to extremism and Islamism in all schools, according to a Dagens Nyheter interview. The minister said this would be a more efficient way to combat extremism and Islamism in schools than the previously proposed ban.\u201c https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-report-on-international-religious-freedom/sweden/"

Bani Mounir have Turkish, French Canadian, Palestinian, Pathan, and Jordanian Bedouin genes mixed in with them.

                "body": "Human Evolution & Creation: Why a Late Adam is Likely\n\n========\n \nIt is likely that Adam\u2019s miraculous creation (without parents) occurred after human-like creatures (HLC) had already populated the Earth and had evolved quite a bit. Why?\n\n1. Adam was a prophet and brought with him special knowledge that most likely included agriculture: \u201cAnd He taught Adam all the names...\u201d (2:31) Fossils indicate that HLC were on Earth long before agriculture.\n\n2. \u201cWe sent not before thee (any messengers) save men whom We inspired from among the folk of the townships...\u201d (12:109) All messengers were from townships. There were no Bedouin messengers, nor hunter-gatherer messengers. In order for there to be law, order, and institutions like marriage, there have to be townships. In order for there to be townships, there needs to be agriculture or some other organized form of food security. HLC existed long before townships existed. According to the majority view, Adam was a messenger. \n\n3. It is a closer comparison to the miraculous creation of Jesus (peace be upon him): \u201cLo! the likeness of Jesus with Allah is as the likeness of Adam.\u201d (3:59) Jesus (peace be upon him) wasn\u2019t created when no humans existed. Rather, he was created differently than other humans. Just like the creation of Jesus (peace be upon him) does not negate the existence of sexual reproduction, the creation of Adam (peace be upon him) does not negate the existence of human evolution. Both sexual reproduction and evolution are means through which Allah creates life on Earth. Miracles and natural laws are not mutually exclusive in our epistemological framework.\n\n4. When the angels asked Allah: \u201cWilt thou place therein one who will do harm therein and will shed blood...?\u201d (2:30), it is more likely that they had direct knowledge of HLC being killers than the traditional explanation that they had witnessed the jinn doing this, as humans have an entirely different nature than jinn. Furthermore, Ibn Katheer and others mention the existence of creations like \u1e24inn and Binn, which may have been earlier HLC. \n\n5. The existence of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA in modern humans could indicate intermarriage. Of course, only Bani Adam are accountable, and only Bani Adam existed at the time of the revelation of the Qur\u2019an.\n\n6. There isn\u2019t a single verse of the Qur\u2019an or a sound hadith that says that the Earth had no HLC on it at the time of Adam\u2019s creation. Rather, much of this is taken from Jewish tradition. Epistemologically, not every aspect of Jewish tradition is reliable, and one can make a solid case for certain aspects of evolutionary science being stronger than Jewish tradition. Furthermore, if we are in the habit of accepting Jewish tradition, then we should at least be aware of that tradition\u2019s mention of Lilith, the supposed first wife of Adam, before the creation of Eve.\n\nFinally, one of the benefits of Adam\u2019s miraculous creation is the pure, adultery-free lineage of God\u2019s messengers:\n\n\u0648\u062e\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064f \u0622\u062f\u0645\u064d \u0648\u062d\u0648\u0651\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u0627 ... \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0646\u0642\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0650 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u0649\n\u0648\u0623\u062b\u0652\u0628\u0650\u062a\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0641\u0627\u0641\u064e \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u064a  ... \u0643\u0630\u0627 \u0644\u0650\u0643\u064f\u0644\u0650\u0651 \u0645\u064f\u0631\u0633\u0644\u064d \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0628\u0650\n\n\n\nThis was written by one of my shaykhs (an ashari)"

Yes, really) an Egyptian hieroglyphic scroll, because he claimed he could translate it. This is pre-Rosetta Stone, so no one could translate it back then. He translated an entirely new book by Abraham, which my people apparently forgot? Unfortunately for Joe, he made really good notes, including markings on the back of the scroll. The scroll was found decades later in a museum and correctly translated as a funerary scroll. Not Abraham\u2019s, BTW. Oops. But the church found a way to get around this- apparently some secret holy message only Joe could read. \n\nMy ancestors did write some weird stuff, but give them a break- it was 3000 years ago! Joe translated this in the 1830s or so!"

Its a terrible book filled with inaccurately constantly contradicts itself. \n\n4 try some of these questions on for size. \n\n  Why does Allah pray? Who is he praying too? If its himself that's a bit egotistical and pointless and bordering on schizophrenic behaviour and if it's too a higher power than him why are you not worshipping that being instead? \n\n  Remember when Allah what Allah said he would do to the prophet if he broke their covenant.....then look at how he died....somebody made Allah angry it seems. \n\n\n  Semen is stored in the chest? \n\n\nThese are just three quick fire ones. There are many.....MANY others. \n\nYour book is no more relevant then the Torah or the Bible or any other holy book.

But the last time the sanhedrine had this power was in 30 CE, nearly 2000 years ago. \n\nThe reality of the religion of Judaism is that the torah can be treated as a constitution, no laws can break its laws and can not be in opposition to these laws (there are minor cases but those are either a logistical thing or the rule that you can break any rule if it's to preserve life).  The kings rule was to enforce the law, sanhedrine interpreted, convicted and made new laws and the priest fulfilled ritual purposes. \n\nThe laws of the jews where made for a land and in some cases a time long ago.  But to say that jews go out and enforce death penalty (though you did not say this) is false, it is from my understanding only Islam allows any random person to enforce punishment.\n\nAlso final thing, not all laws are literal, there is one that says that if you disrespect your parents you shall die but this is considered by the Sages ( predecessors to what would be modern-day rabbis) that this was not literal but hyperbole"

But if your implying that it's bad that jews lost there power you don't understand what I'm getting at, these laws are the laws of a people of a nation that no longer exist, Christianity is what we think more of as a religion and Islam is a religion to conquer.  Judaism doesn't wish for violence and as I've said it was rare for death sentences to be given.  \n\nJudaism could be looked at as a Proto democratic constitutional monarchy.  The state has clear defined separations of Power with three branches the Sanhedrin, the king and the high priest.  The Sanhedrin itself was partially copied off of the Roman senate in the Roman Republic.  And though those chosen to the Sanhedrin which was a court of 71 Sages later rabbis were not entirely elected by the people well that's where we get the Proto\n\nBut you're right the ideas of idolatry don't exist in these other cultures and did not exist in the cultures around them.  This is because Judaism developed much different than these other religions.  Jews are required to only worship one g-d as such it is prohibited for them to commit idolatry.  But these rules only apply to Jews and in the times of ancient Judea the Gentiles that lived in the land.  Compare this to Christianity or Islam which are Universalist religions that the man that all people worship as they do then yes the laws are alien.\n\nAnd the golden calf story is a Jewish one, Moses comes down from Mount Sinai after receiving the Ten Commandments and find the Israelites worshiping a golden calf, out of shock he smashes the Ten Commandments and the punish them puts the gold into their drinking water. He then goes all the way back up Mount Sinai and comes back down with the Ten Commandments.\n\nAlso the Jews losing their power in Judea should not be glorified because it means that people were pushed out of their land and this probably help the nearly 2,000 years of persecution."

Furthermore archaeologically speaking Jews probably are the original people I think there's like one other group they found before but they aren't so sure about those people, The Bible Tells a Story that they came from Egypt but modern anthropologists do not believe this but rather that the story of Egypt either was a northern kingdom story that came about because at one point Egypt had conquered the Levant or came about as a story when the northern kingdom Israel was conquered by the Babylonians and a massive amount of refugees entered into Judea the southern kingdom and as a way to unite all the peoples of these different tribes they came up with this story and probably a mix of both.\n\nJews had already been spreading out of Judea by the time of the Roman Conquest but this was because of economic reasons, Alexandria at one point in the time of antiquity had the most Jews outside of Jerusalem.  The Jews were officially exiled in 136 CE after a failed revolt, before this Exile Christianity had already started to form and spreading throughout the Roman Empire.  \n\nChristianity itself has a lot more Pagan or Roman and European influence then judaic because at a certain point in time there was more Gentile followers than Jews anymore.  This is why if you ever compare Jewish interpretations to Christian interpretations of the Bible they are quite different.  Christianity was started by followers of Jesus who are both Jews and Gentiles.  For most of Christian history Jews had no influence over the religion except for the origin.\n\nIslam does take inspiration from Judaism but takes more from Christianity, I cannot tell you specifically but anytime I've heard Scholars speak on this this is what they say.  I've heard two theories on the creation of Islam though I'm not very versed on them the first being that was created by Muhammad and then he used it to conquer Arabia the second is that it was actually created by one of his like generals or kings.  Basically one Theory says Muhammad credit the second theory says someone else made it but I assume you know this because I believe you mentioned something about a caliphate doing this already.\n\nTo insist that Judaism in any form spread their religion or influence other people with it to gain power is not only untrue but anti-Semitic.  Juice for the vast majority of their history have been an incredibly poor and isolated people.  Living a second class citizens and guests in whatever country they may reside.  \n\nPeople have been conquered by other people for thousands of years and there's nothing we can do about that but that doesn't mean it was a good thing in the first place."

The importance of living in harmony with nature, do not exploit nature excessively. Preserve the jungle, preserve the river etc..  \n4. Reincarnation of soul with unifying back with Hyang as ultimate goal, similar to Hinduism conception of Mokhsa and Buddhism conception of Nirvana.  \n5. Acknowledgement of 5 genders, Male body with masculine soul, Female body with feminime soul, Male body with feminime soul, Female body with masculine soul and Bhissu, a well balanced soul in male or female body. A LGBTQ+ friendly religion..\n\nSo far I haven't found craziness like...  \n1. God could have an enemy (since hyang is infinite/borderless).  \n2. Fighting for god / religion will earn 72 virgins.  \n3. God demanding animal or human sacrifice to forgive a sin.  \n4. A father killing his own son considered as a hero.\n\nAnd one particular group (the baduys in west java) have an ancient ritual of male circumcision, which makes me wonder...  but no trace of a father killing his own son."

These are all not found in the Quran but the Hadith.\n\nAnd just FYI, bringing up the \"strong and weak\" here is really out of place, since the Hadith you were shown was graded as authentic.\n\n> If I\u2019m wrong; please educate me without calling me names and being a dick. If not, and you dismiss all of my comment; I\u2019ll go ask my imam on Tuesday.\n\nExcuse me what? You come here, assert things that are wrong, and expect people to treat you with kids gloves? Sorry buddy, if you want to be educated, then **ask questions** rather than spreading bullshit.\n\nAnd if you need to ask your imam about something as simple as the Hadith, then maybe you ought to shut up, sit down, and educate yourself **before** speaking?\n\n> But yeah, You hit the nail on the head man.

I would do the same if someone joined a white nationalist group.\n\n> I\u2019ve been pretty close to suicide a few times and if this is the only thing that keeps my head above water, according to you I should go kill myself, right?\n\nWrong. You should seek professional help and actually treat the root problem, rather than finding a temporary patch that's going to hurt you more in the long term.\n\n> I\u2019m sorry you found such negativity in your studies of Islam. I\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t separate shitty people and their actions from a religion that ultimately tries to keep people honest and good.\n\nBuddy, you've literally been shown that the shitty part comes from Mohammed himself. Maybe take a seat and reflect on that rather than continuing to bullshit.\n\n> At best, I would\u2019ve found you to be like, \u2018nah, this ain\u2019t the religion for me\u2019 and move on.\n\nSpoken like a true ignoramous. Tell me, if you had escaped a cult that had crazy rules such as killing people for leaving the cult, would you try to help others who may have wandered into the cult because they wanted a fix for their depression?\n\n> Bur you treat people like this on the internet. Says a lot about you I would think. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nYeah I treat people spreading lies the way they ought to be treated: Telling them that they are ignorant on the matter at hand. If **that** was too rough for you, then you're up for a rough awakening kiddo.\n\n> Anyways, I doubt you\u2019ll make it this far so. Babbabooie. Love you \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI love how Muslims assume that because they have the attention span of a goldfish, and think that reading a \"holy book\" that's the length of the first Harry Potter book is an accomplishment, everyone else has the same disability.

                "body": "> Your point didn\u2019t really make sense, and is irrelevant to the conversation.\n\nJust say you didn't understand it. No need to be embarrassed.\n\n> I feel like you wanted to just equate Islam to Nazis.\n\nI did not equate the two. Your lack of reading comprehension is not a problem with the example.\n\n> Nazis persecuted Jews, the wehrmacht didn\u2019t.\n\nAnd? How is that relevant? I was talking about the Nazis not the Wehrmacht.\n\n> Well it wasn\u2019t their main goal.\n\nCorrect. And being a pedo death cult isn't the main goal of Islam, but it is a thing.\n\n> I can use logic to separate two things, what is your point?\n\nLet's see: You used \"logic\" to divert the conversation to talking about the Wehrmarcht rather than the Nazis. In logical terms we call that [ignoratio elenchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrelevant_conclusion). Better luck next time.\n\nMy point is, and remains: Islam is a pedo death cult. And I find it quite telling that you intentionally ignored the comment showing it to be at least a pedo cult after asking for it: https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1etp9t1/an_agonizing_sentiment_shared_by_many_exmuslims/lij8kh6/?context=3\n\nSo tell me, why should I take you seriously when you seem hellbent on not engaging with the sources, incapable of reading comprehension and logic, and so ignorant about Islam (the religion you married into, not the one you were convinced into) that you didn't know what Hadiths are? Feels like [playing chess against a pigeon](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11427530-arguing-with-idiots-is-like-playing-chess-with-a-pigeon)."

                "body": ">it\u2019s because god sends tests\n\nWhy? Why would a God feel the need to test anyone or anything? Especially when he knows the outcome of all.\n\nBeing God doesn't make sense, either. You exist for eternity, you know everything, you can do everything, but before you do them you already know the outcome. You encompass everything. You just exist to exist. Like, literally, just existing doing jackshit. It doesn't make any sense.\n\n>the slavery you talk about isn\u2019t the western demonic slavery everyone gets the idea it is\n\nSlavery is slavery.\n\n>all humans are created equal in the eyes of allah\n\nNot really, you have a privilege of saying this because you're not born without limbs, or with defects. Why is one person's life harder than yours? Why do you go through life on easy mode while someone else goes through hard mode and how is this in any shape or form considered \"fair\" or \"just\"? Especially from a being who's considered to be the ultimate fair and just one. You might say \"but they go to heaven\" (which is a baseless claim), let's say that's the case, that would still make God unjust and unfair because if living like that makes you go to an eternal paradise easier, I'd have wanted to be born that way as well.\n\n>and again tests are necessary.\n\nWhy is a test necessary? Are you saying Allah is forced to create humans and test them?"

For them, \"the reason their Muslim majority countries, with largely pro-Islamic policies, is failing at being a country, because it's *not Islamic enough.*\"\n\nI'm not talking about illiterate people bro. Literally college educated people have these views. Not even boomers. Gen-X, Millennials and Gen-Z.\n\nYes, Islamists are vocal minorities, even in Muslim majority nations. But they have all the funding, all the media presence, all the political tools to influence policies, and the moderates' response ranges from silent condoning to gentle dissuasion, which has the effect of covering yourself in bubble wrap in a warzone."

The Quran also clearly has an obsession with calling non Muslims blind, as well as insults being thrown here and there to make them seem lesser to the Muslims. And yeah, dont forget the Quran verse where Allah \u201cwages war\u201d on anyone who goes against the Prophet.

                "body": ">I don't know how old you are mate but your blind optimism in the face of grim reality is maddening.\n\nI should probably add a /s to most of what I say considering it seems to infuriate you. I'm sorry it does. \n\nI don't know if you are aware of my own story, but I assure you, I'm not a blind optimist, I may sound like one, but I'm not. I've had enough experience with the worst side of Islam to understand the seriousness of the situation (although let's be honest, the genuine chance Islamists will succeed in the west is absolutely minute to non existent, just as much as the moderate or liberal Muslim reforming Islam is minimal or non existent - for now - maybe the population boom will factor in, but the discourse of anti-islam that's taken hold in the west isn't going away soon, and probably will get stronger and louder) but not allow myself to be bathed in sheer animosity for the people I'll never be able to disconnect myself from literally, because they'll always be there - unless I can Thanos them out of existence, and I'm not going to do that even if I could because I can still make the distinction that so many on here cannot do, or don't want to, so maybe I'd selectively Thanos then, who knows?... This isn't an accusation at you, I'm just explaining myself. \n\n>You know full well what you hope for ain't happening.\n\nI know it isn't, but I can still say it in the hopes that some Muslim will read it and recognise that nobody is going to save Islam from itself except the fool who attempts to reform it at their peril.\n\n>And Muslims would rightly be branded as munafiqs/hypocrites if they argue against Dar Al Islam anyway.\n\nYes yes, I know... I was branded as one (not literally with a hot poker and a stamp, though I was burned) \n\n>For them, \"the reason their Muslim majority countries, with largely pro-Islamic policies, is failing at being a country, because it's not Islamic enough.\"\n\nI know, I heard enough of this from my parents generation, and even my cousins. \n\n>I'm not talking about illiterate people bro. Literally college educated people have these views. Not even boomers. Gen-X, Millennials and Gen-Z.\n\nI know, I have a 13 year old cousin who's so brainwashed by Dawah Tiktok she legit thinks that Aisha had the best example of a marriage ever and Safiya wasnt raped, and even women get male sex slaves in the afterlife so why are women complaining about men having sex slaves/houris.\n\n>Yes, Islamists are vocal minorities, even in Muslim majority nations. But they have all the funding, all the media presence, all the political tools to influence policies, and the moderates' response ranges from silent condoning to gentle dissuasion, which has the effect of covering yourself in bubble wrap in a warzone.\n\nI know, most of its funded by Saudi Salafi money going into making schools and mosques in the west, cynically hoping to export its extremists out of their country whilst they attempt to \"modernise\" it, and yes you're right about that as well, the moderate response is weak to non existent at best, but please do understand, this sub gets so many comments about bashing Muslims, Muslim countries, there's enough negativity in it, why should I also add to that? I'd rather leave some trace of hope, even if it comes across as blind optimism. I also do my fair share of bashing on this sub, but I'm not going to go overboard again, I've been reported plenty of times on the mildest of comments, and banned 3 times.\n\nNow take Curiousjack6 - he didn't even say anything inflammatory, just basic rebuttals with references to the text sources and a little bit of satire in the mix. The GOAT got banned and hasn't returned. \n\nThere was once a time on here you could have a whole thread of jokes and some levity without the need to actually say out loud that the situation is hopeless or fucked."

According to Muslims, this is God speaking through Gabriel, directly to the final Prophet...and telling him to lop off people's hands and feet and to crucify people.

It automatically happened because I decided to sleep and wasn't a willing refrainment.\nYes, if someone is a sexually ill person and gets motivated to rape the first human he sees in the street, but refrains from it, he makes the *choice* of not raping that person.

I would have killed them according to the statement of Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa), 'Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him.'\"\n\nFirst of all, what you sent has a historically weak source as the only person who narrated this from Ibn Abbas is Ayoub ibn Abi Tamimah, who claims to have heard this from Ikrimah al-Barbari. In Shi'ism, Ikrimah is widely known as someone who **forged** hadith from Ibn Abbas.  \nPutting this hadith aside, killing others solely because of their personal beliefs is against Quran teachings (2:256)  and there is no *valid* historical evidence that the Prophet or the Imams did anything like that. If anything, someone like [Ja'far al-Sadiq]() had many debates with materialists and atheists. If converting to Islam wasn't a choice, then these people must've been killed by the Islamic government, let alone the debates.  \nIn the modern days, even in an ideological country like Iran, you *unofficially* are allowed to have any ideology you want. There are actual Jews in Iran for example. You can't change your religion from Islam officially (they won't change it for you in your identity certificate) but you'd be completely fine even if you become an atheist. The problem starts when you advertise your turning against Islam in public (which includes announcing your own apostasy to the society). So yeah, Islam is a choice. What's written in your identity certificate in some countries doesn't necessarily relate with your own beliefs.  \nSo your claim about death penalties for apostasy is false. Before accusing others of lying, educate yourself first.  \n\n\n>Allah doesn't allow Muslims to pick and choose, and threatens them with hellfire if they pick and choose.\n\nOf course he does. You clearly don't know what a *choice* means. I've defined what a choice is in my previous comment, re-read that again. If I offer you a red pill, resulting in your death, and a blue pill, resulting in your well-being, I'm giving you two choices. Yes, every sane person chooses the blue pill. But I'm still giving you the power to make a choice. Here's the same case as well. According to Islam's principles, as a muslim, if you don't follow Islam's rules, you'll face the natural consequences but that doesn't make you immune to committing sins, so you still have the choice to sin or not.  \nHellfire is the natural consequence of your immoral acts. God doesn't \"threaten\" you with it, he *warns* that if certain things are done, hell is the destination. Hellfire is simply the natural incarnation of your sins. Nothing more. Just like a ball that drops down when you let loose of it due to Earth's gravity.  \nNo surprise you're an ex-muslim, you don't even know the very first things about your own former religion. Punishment for immoral acts apply to everyone, not only muslims. Every muslim is physically capable of committing crimes and sins just like others. Have you ever seen a divine hammer fall upon a so-called muslim who wants to bomb himself up in an innocent crowd? Have you ever witnessed a muslim suddenly becoming mute in the middle of his speech before he begins to lie? Everyone is completely free to do whatever they want, but they have to pay for the consequences. Again, instead of accusing me of lying, learn more before making claims which are based upon your incomplete knowledge. Re-read 2:256 and 2:257.\n\n>\n\nIt seems you don't have the mental capacity to read what I wrote properly. Which part of my that paragraph is a lie? I'm awaiting an answer. I explicitly wrote hijab is a *LEGAL* **OBLIGATION.** But you **have** the **CHOICE** to disobey, (that is what at least 10% of women do in Iran) which results in some possible legal actions taken against you. It's not that hard to understand FFS."

                "body": "> First of all, what you sent has a historically weak source as the only person who narrated this from Ibn Abbas is Ayoub ibn Abi Tamimah, who claims to have heard this from Ikrimah al-Barbari. In Shi'ism, Ikrimah is widely known as someone who forged hadith from Ibn Abbas.\n\nI love it when muslims start discrediting Muhammad's own sahabas like Ikrimah.\n\nYou do realize that hadiths (even the Quran) is a game of telephone? If one discredits someone's integrity within an isnad (chain of narration), then one can start discrediting all hadiths that include that specific narrator.\n\n[Here is the apostasy punishment hadith in Sunan Nasai 4059\u00a0with an isnad not involving Ikrimah.](https://sunnah.com/nasai:4059)\n\n[Here is a hadith narrated by Ali, who you'll probably discredit, despite you being a shia](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6930)\n\nDespite your little grievances, revered institutes such as Darussalam and Al Azhar classify them sahih.\u00a0Funny how nobody questioned Ikrimah for all these years, till recently, now that people have started noticing the punishment for apostasy.\n\n> Putting this hadith aside, killing others solely because of their personal beliefs is against Quran teachings (2:256).\n\nLmao putting it aside because bro doesn't like its contents. Classic muslim apologist. I know you've never read a lick of Islamic scripture beyond the ones of often quipped by social media. Ever heard of a thing called naskh? It's when allah reveals a verse that trumps a previously revealed verse. It's even mentioned in the Quran.\n\nQuran 2:106 -\u00a0We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that All\u0101h is over all things competent?\n\nDo you know which verses trumps 2:256?\n\nQuran 2:190 -\u00a0Fight in the way of All\u0101h those who fight against you but do not transgress. Indeed, All\u0101h does not like transgressors.\n\nQuran 9:5 -\u00a0Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.\n\nLet me link\u00a0the tafsirs of these two verses: [Ibn Kathir 9:5](https://quran.ksu.edu.sa/tafseer/katheer/sura9-aya5.html) and [Ibn Kathir 2:190](https://quran.ksu.edu.sa/tafseer/katheer/sura2-aya190.html). I've done you the honors of quoting the arabic sites, so you can't get away with your lies using whitewashed english translations.\n\n2:190: Abu Jaafar Al-Razi said, on the authority of Al-Rabi\u2019 bin Anas, on the authority of Abu Al-Aliyah, in the Almighty\u2019s saying: (And fight in the way of God those who fight you) He said: This is the first verse that was revealed about fighting in Medina. When it was revealed, the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, would fight whoever fought him, and refrain from whoever He desisted from it until Surah Baqar\u2019ah was revealed, and so did Abd al-Rahman bin Zaid bin Aslam until he said: This is abrogated by his saying: (So kill the polytheists wherever you find them) [Al-Tawbah: 5]\n\n9:5: And his saying: (So kill the polytheists wherever you find them) meaning: from the land.\u00a0This is general, and it is well-known that it specifically prohibits fighting in the Sacred Mosque by saying: (And do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque until they fight you there. If they fight you, then kill them) [Al-Baqarah: 191].\n\n> and there is no valid historical evidence that the Prophet or the Imams did anything like that.\n\nFrom Sirat Rasul Allah by Ibn Ishaq -\n\n\"Abdullah Sa'd was ordered to be killed as he had been a Muslim and used to write down revelation; then he apostatized and returned to Quraysh. He was brought to the apostle after the situation in Mecca was tranquil, and asked that he might be granted immunity. They allege that the apostle remained silent for a long time till finally he said yes. When Uthman had left, he said to his companions who were sitting around him,\u00a0**I kept silent so that one of you might get up and strike off his head!\u2019 One of the Ansar said, \"Then why didn't you give me a sign, O apostle of God?\u2019 He answered that a prophet does not kill by pointing.**\"\n\nAlso see [Ridda Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridda_Wars)\n\n> If anything, someone like Ja'far al-Sadiq had many debates with materialists and atheists.\n\nJafari Fiqh by Ruhollah Khomeini, Tahrir al-Wasilar Volumie IV (English translation), p.255-256 -\n\n\"So Islam of a Murtad al-Fitri shall apparently not be accepted, **after he has first apostatized and he shall be condemned to death if he is male**, but a woman shall not be condemned to death even if she is Murtadda al-Fitriya, but shall be kept in life imprisonment, and she shall be given beatings at the times of prayer, and she shall be subjected to tightening or scarcity of food.\"\n\n> The problem starts when you advertise your turning against Islam in public (which includes announcing your own apostasy to the society).\n\nIf Islam is secure on its standings, surely someone saying they no longer believe in it wouldn't be a problem?\n\n> If I offer you a red pill, resulting in your death, and a blue pill, resulting in your well-being, I'm giving you two choices. Yes, every sane person chooses the blue pill.\n\nBuddy, in case you've missed primary education, a choice is based on free will. If there's a consequence for picking the wrong option, it's no longer a choice. One could stick a gun to a woman's head and get her consent for sexual intercourse. So is that a choice for the woman, since her saying \"No\" would lead to her death? Of course, I don't expect muslims to understand this.\n\n> Hellfire is the natural consequence of your immoral acts. God doesn't \"threaten\" you with it, he warns that if certain things are done, hell is the destination.\n\nExcept allah already knows who's going to hell, as he preordains everyone's fate (Quran 54:49). Not much of a choice if your path is already fixed.\n\n> No surprise you're an ex-muslim, you don't even know the very first things about your own former religion.\n\nNo surprise you're a muslim. You define forcing someone to choose under the threat of punishment for non-compliance as \"Choice\". Maybe apply for welfare. You surely need it with that mental capacity.\n\n> I explicitly wrote hijab is a LEGAL OBLIGATION. But you have the CHOICE to disobey.\n\nBuddy, now you're playing with semantics to cover your lies. Again, and again, and again, you've tried to peddle \"Punishment for non-compliance\" as \"having choice\" and \"non-obligatory\".\n\nLike I said before, liars like you shouldn't be part of civil society."

It's about Kharijites.\n\n>such as Darussalam and Al Azhar\n\nWe don't accept them as flawless.\n\n>Funny how nobody questioned Ikrimah for all these years, till recently now that people have started noticing the punishment for apostasy.\n\nThat's not true. It may be right in Sunnism, I don't know. What I know is that Ikrimah is known as a liar in Shi'ism.\n\nIn Tahthib'ol'Kamal which is older than 600 years, we have:\n\n>[ \u0639\u0643\u0631\u0645\u0629\u00a0\u0643\u0630\u0627\u0628\u00a0\u064a\u062d\u062f\u062b \u063a\u062f\u0648\u0629 \u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b\u0627 \u064a\u062e\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0647 \u0639\u0634\u064a\u0629](https://lib.eshia.ir/40342/20/286/%D9%83%D8%B0%D8%A7%D8%A8)\n\n>\u2248  Ikrimah is a huge liar who narrates a hadith one morning and contradicts it in evening\n\nYour problem is your assumptions. Not everything you've read about Sunnism applies to us.\n\n>\u00a0I know you've never read a lick of Islamic scripture beyond the ones of often quipped by social media\n\nI'm afraid that's not true. I've read all of Quran for at least 2 times. Stop taking baseless assumptions.\n\n>Ever heard of a thing called naskh?\n\n2:256 is not among the mansookh verses. Every mansookh verse is already specified. None of the verses you sent trump 2:256, it's you who lacks the IQ to understand what they mean.\n\n>Fight in the way of All\u0101h those **who fight against you**\n\n>It clearly says those who \"fight against you\" not those who have existed Islam. In other words, it says defend yourselves against those who have the intention of harming you. It has nothing to do with 2:256. Make sure to read properly before sending something.  \nThe second verse was also about the Kafirs who were in war with muslims. This one also has nothing to do with 2:256 as well.  \nShia has its own tafsirs and Ibn-Kathir isn't one of them, so I won't even bother looking the links you sent up. I don't think they mention anything different than what I said though.\n\n\n\n>So kill the polytheists wherever you find them\n\nIt says **the** polytheists. It doesn't mean every polytheist. You should check the verses before and after it. If you look it up, this sura is regarding the polytheists who are in war with muslims. Not those who are in peace with them. I don't have the time nor the mood to write the whole story behind this verse, just go and check it yourself.\n\n>Abdullah Sa'd was ordered to be killed\n\nHe was questioning Muhammed being a prophet in public while he was in Mecca. That's why the prophet wanted him to be killed, not because he reverted from Islam.\n\n>Also see\u00a0Ridda Wars\n\nRidda wars were started after the prophet's death, and none of the imams participated in them.\n\n>after he has first apostatized and he shall be condemned to death if he is male\n\nBefore this, the apostasy of that guy must be proved (which is written before this part of Khomeini's book) As for the proof, it requires him would require him to publicly announce is apostasy to begin with, so it's not as simple as \"if you happen to find out someone has reverted from islam, you should report him\" the islamic goverment won't even accept your report without proper proof. \n\n>If Islam is secure on its standings, surely someone saying they no longer believe in it wouldn't be a problem?\n\nThe reason behind this rule is another subject. I can elaborate on this but the subject of the discussion would change. To keep it short, an islamic government needs to not let people lose their faith by any (moral) mean. The announcement of reverting from Islam may not have that of an impact on most people, but there are some people who'll start doubting their faith when they hear it (especially the ones who aren't educated or don't think a lot about these stuff) and it's not something the islamic government should allow. If my answer was satisfying or not doesn't matter since it's not the subject of the topic. \n\n>a choice is based on free will. If there's a consequence for picking the wrong option, it's no longer a choice\n\nThat's where you're wrong. Yes, the choice is based on free will. But the consequences don't make your will limited. Even the person who has a gun sticking to his head **can choose** to die instead of being raped.   \nMuslims can choose to lie, despite the consequences they believe they'll face.   \nSome people in Iran tend to choose not wear hijab, despite the legal actions they may be taken against.\n\n>Except Allah already knows who's going to hell\n\nLet's not get near this subejct. Determinism and freedom is a really complex philosophical concept which I don't think any of us is prepared for.\n\n>as he preordains everyone's fate (Quran 54:49). Not much of a choice if your path is already fixed.\n\nThat verse doesn't say that. The translation of that verse would be: Indeed We have created everything in a measure,  \n\n\n Anyways, I know enough of what my religion says regarding this issue. I've probably read more about this topic than everything you've read in your life combined altogether. You don't need to tell me what my religion says about this topic, I know it. And it's not what you claim it is.\n\n>you're playing with semantics to cover your lies\n\nI'm not \"playing with semantics\" I'm just looking at this concept in a purely abstract and logical angle. That's how it should be in a logical discussion."

I'm not talking about Sunnism).  \nExcept the two, most of them are Halal and the others are Makruh, which means it's better if you refrain from doing them but if you don't, it's fine (you haven't committed a sin).  \nFor example listening to music is completely fine by itself but it must not contain suggestive themes, but again, the same thing applies to everything, not only music.  \nRegarding pork and beard-shaving, it's all about ethics.  \nWe don't know the exact philosophy behind why eating pork is haram, there are some hadiths in our sources which imply it's due to the loathsomeness of this animal (not necessarily in a material way). There are also other hadith that point out some other reasons but I personally don't know how accurate they are (=not sure if they're forged or not) & they're really weird so I won't share them here.  \nThat leaves beard-shaving. It comes from the principle that we must not make change in temperaments The God has put (check out Quran 4:119) and since beard is part of a male's temperaments, it's not allowed to be completely removed.   \nBy the way, I have no idea where you got creativity being haram from. I'm pretty sure it's not even implied in Sunnism as some of the greatest mathematicians like Kharazmi (the founder of algebra and algorithm) and Khayyam (who contributed a lot to mathematics, logic, and philosophy in his era) were muslims, And these two are very likely to not be Shia.\n\nAnyways, I'm replying this to do a friendly reminder that not everything contained in Sunnism is directly related to Islam, but it's the interpretation of **some** people, who unfortunately form most of muslims at this date."

There are other verses in Quran which contain this verb and have this meaning as well, such as 4:101 which says \"traveling on the earth\"  \nThe reason most believe it means \"hitting\" is because of some hadiths surrounding this verse. However, the main thing these people don't consider is that such a thing coincides other principles in Islam. There are narratively-stronger hadiths that forbid you from this. Check:  \n[72, 73, and 74](https://www.al-islam.org/islam-and-interactions-social-life-abolfazl-sabouri/verses-traditions-about-family#72-punishment-beating-ones-wife).\n\nEven there are verses which clearly forbid hitting women in the Quran itself.\n\n>4:19 - ....[Consort with them (women) in an honorable manner](https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/st8.htm#:~:text=consort%20with%20them%20in%20an%20honourable%20manner%3B) (open with Chrome or any other browser that supports link-to-text-highlighting)\n\nHell, the meaning you (and most people) take from the verse you're talking about doesn't even match what's prior to this statement. It says \\[first\\] advise them, and \\[if ineffective\\] keep away from them in the bed and \\[if that was ineffective as well\\] **move away from the house**. NOT beat them.  \nWhich one makes more sense? \"*Keep away from them in the bed and \\[if not effective, on the last resort\\]* **move away from the house**\" or \"*Keep away from them in the bed and \\[if not effective, on the last resort\\]* **hit them**\"?\n\nAs I said earlier, this misunderstanding is due to forged hadiths which made Muslims take that wrong interpretation."

                "body": "You're trying to claim that these verses from the Quran are some kind of open-ended call for violence against all non-Muslims, right? Well, that\u2019s a pretty *wild* stretch.\n\n\u00a0Let\u2019s start with **Quran 9:5**. You\u2019re quoting Qurtubi, Ibn Kathir, and others, but the way you\u2019re using their words is like taking a sentence out of a movie and pretending it tells the whole story. When they talk about \"killing the polytheists,\" they\u2019re talking about a specific situation where the Quraysh had broken their peace treaties and were constantly attacking the Muslim community.\u00a0\n\nThis isn\u2019t some eternal rule; it was a response to a direct threat in 7th-century Arabia.\u00a0 Even Ibn Kathir mentions the exception of the Kaaba\u2019s sanctuary, which shows that it wasn\u2019t just \"kill anyone, anywhere, anytime.\" It was about dealing with a specific group that was actively trying to wipe out the Muslims.\u00a0 \u00a0\nNow, on to **Quran 9:29**\u2014this one\u2019s often misunderstood. You quoted Ibn Kathir saying the verse was about fighting the People of the Book after dealing with the polytheists. But, bro, you gotta look at the whole picture.\u00a0\n\nThe verse was revealed when the Muslim community was under threat from the Byzantine Empire (aka the Romans). The Prophet wasn\u2019t like, \"Hey, let\u2019s just go attack some Christians and Jews for fun.\" He was responding to a real, documented threat where the Byzantines were gearing up for war.\u00a0\n\nThis is about *self-defense*, not unprovoked aggression. Ibn Kathir even mentions that the Prophet Muhammad prepared to march to Tabuk, but ended up not fighting because the threat didn't materialize. If this was about attacking just for the sake of it, he would've kept going, right? But he didn\u2019t. He turned back because the immediate danger was gone.\u00a0 So, when you say \"it wasn\u2019t war,\" that\u2019s not just bending the truth\u2014it\u2019s ignoring it completely. The verses you\u2019re talking about are rooted in very specific historical contexts. They\u2019re not a free pass for violence; they\u2019re guidelines for dealing with enemies who were already on the attack.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0TL;DR: You can\u2019t just pull out a verse or a quote from a tafsir and act like it\u2019s the whole story. You gotta dig deeper, look at the context, and understand that these verses are about dealing with specific threats, not promoting endless war.\u00a0"

I'll address that. The Wikiislam comment isn't mine, but anyone interested can find it it in the linked post.\n\n> You're trying to claim that these verses from the Quran are some kind of open-ended call for violence against all non-Muslims, right? Well, that\u2019s a pretty wild stretch.\n\nIs it a wild stretch when Saadi says \"Allah's words 'kill the polytheist' is applied as a general command **for all polytheists**\"? Pretty wild of you to say that the four tafsirs I quoted are all wrong.\n\n> you\u2019re using their words is like taking a sentence out of a movie and pretending it tells the whole story\n\nDo you expect me to write the whole tafsir, including the irrelevant parts here? I literally linked the tafsirs, so if you think I left out something important that contradicts my statements, please show it.\n\n> When they talk about \"killing the polytheists,\" they\u2019re talking about a specific situation where the Quraysh had broken their peace treaties and were constantly attacking the Muslim community. \n\nDid you **read the fucking tafsir**? They are literally linked! How does \"In any place any time\" mean that it's \"just the ones we are at war with\"? Did you pass school level reading comprehension?\n\n> This isn\u2019t some eternal rule; it was a response to a direct threat in 7th-century Arabia. \n\nSource: Trust me bro.\n\n> You quoted Ibn Kathir saying the verse was about fighting the People of the Book after dealing with the polytheists. But, bro, you gotta look at the whole picture. \n\nOK bro let's look at the whole picture bro. Bro you're going to be quoting actual sources here, right bro?\n\n> The verse was revealed when the Muslim community was under threat from the Byzantine Empire (aka the Romans). The Prophet wasn\u2019t like, \"Hey, let\u2019s just go attack some Christians and Jews for fun.\" He was responding to a real, documented threat where the Byzantines were gearing up for war. \n\nThe Byzantines had zero interest in backwater Arabia. The Sassanid and Byzantine/Roman empires had been fighting for centuries, and neither of them bothered with Arabia.\n\nYou claim that it was a response to a threat, yet Ibn Kathir mentions no threat. Even sources that claim that Mohammed got bad intel that the Byzantines were attacking Tabuk admit that they weren't actually attacking. You got two choices: Either Allah can be fooled by false intel, or Allah commanded invading the Byzantines. Your choice.\n\n> You gotta dig deeper, look at the context, and understand that these verses are about dealing with specific threats, not promoting endless war. \n\nToo bad you didn't provide any context. All you provided is \"trust me bro\". If you want to argue the matter, you gotta provide the actual quotes that show the context I left out."

        "text": "Hello so I converted to Islam when I was 15. I only know the basic fluffy version and I was also in a position where I thought I was dying and it was an answer to all my suffering. I\u2019m 17 now and not dying luckily but I have researched a lot more deeply into Islam and uncovered stuff with help from creators like AP. I have only just decided to leave and although I decided to leave based on Information the abuse I received in certain Muslim communities was a pushing factor. \n\nObviously leaving turns your whole world upside down and I\u2019m still not confident in my decision ( also on an side note if anyone has any resources disproving Islam further I would really appreciate it I might ask again in an separate post ) \n\nSo anyways I made the big decision today of leaving the revert group chat today I literally had to hype myself up because I was scared. For context This group was extremely ableist towards me and cut me off due to their inability to treat me like an human in my worst moments of my life ( I don\u2019t cry ableism but their interactions and reactions to me was so shocking - I don\u2019t rlly want to go into detail but it was VERY bad ) . I only spoke to them once after one of them ditched me in a town I didn\u2019t know and that was to defend Jewish people from their hatful extreamism. These are all adults btw and I was 16 when most of this happened and their behaviour towards me was very much immature and inappropriate. \n\nBut now iv received this message and it\u2019s making me feel bad even though I know that they didn\u2019t want to include me and put me though hell and they where never there for me they only wanted me in the religion. This message is insane though as they are acting like they have always been there for me when all Muslims iv met have done is oppress me. \n\nI\u2019m sorry I just really need to just get this off my chest I have no support or community behind me and I only left last week and saying that makes me feel panicky and although iv been doing an tremendous amount of research I\u2019m still unsure about things. \n\nThank you for listening.",

But in the end, if you leave Christianity or wven their particular form of Christianity, you are doomed. Don't let the kind words fool you. Be true to the call of God as God moves you."

Should any bhikkhun\u012b, when a bhikkhu is eating, attend on him with water or a fan, it is to be confessed. (Meaning a nun shouldn't bring a monk glass of water or fan him, like treating the monk like king or something like that)\n\n\nAlso, here, some rules for Buddhist monk :\n\n\n4. Should any bhikkhu have a used robe washed, dyed, or beaten by a bhikkhun\u012b unrelated to him, it is to be forfeited and confessed.\n\n\n17. Should any bhikkhu have wool washed, dyed, or carded by a bhikkhun\u012b unrelated to him, it is to be forfeited and confessed.\n\n\n(Meaning the monks must clean his own clothes and cannot make the women do it for him, unless the lady is his mom/grandma/sister/female family member)\n\n\nSo don't join any religion until you are old enough (if you must absolutely believe in religions), Buddhism is pretty misogynistic, it was Ananda who persuade Buddha to allow women to be a monk (which take a few years and Buddha think the buddhist teaching won't survive with women in it)\n\n\nAnd then we have this from a Buddhist story :\n\n\nThe Buddha, unlike any other religious teacher, spoke well of women. He said, \"Some women are better than men, O king. There are women who are wise and good, who regard their mothers-in-law as goddesses, and who are pure in word, thought and deed. They may one day give birth to brave sons who would rule a country\" (context : the king's wife gave birth to a daughter and he is disappointed at the baby's gender)\n\n\nSo I guess female buddhist have Ananda to thank for when it comes to learning buddhist teaching (friendly reminder, Siddhartha Gautama=Buddha)\n\n\nAs for buddhist community/society, thai buddhists are pretty chill (my experience in thailand), but the burmese (iirc) one tho, they are extremist (kind of?), japanese buddhist is pretty chill too (not to be confused with Shinto). In conclusion, among all the misogynistic religions, Buddha at least, grow to respect women SLIGHTLY (again, thanks to Ananda's respect women juice lmao)"

You have more lenient family members close by.\n4. You have access to a doctor.\n5. You can drive.\n6. You have access to a car.\n7. You alone drive alone.\n8. You can get access to a P.O. Box.\n\nIf I was in your shoes, I would explain the situation to my friend, and then (if they agree and you trust them) ask them if you can deliver and hide your \"cute clothes\" at their place. I'm not saying this is a permanent solution, so I wouldn't order more than 5 complete outfits (25 pieces total) (5 tops, 5 pants, 5 pairs of shoes, etc...). You will also need a travel suitcase for storage for quick in-and-out action is required.\n\n Then, when you go to school or out, you stop by your friend's place to pick up your travel suitcase; go to school; and in between classes or when you go to the bathroom just change and come back. Then, by the end of the day, change back, drop your travel suitcase back at your friend's place, and go home. Repeat when desired.\n\nIf a trustworthy friend isn't available, replace them with a P.O. Box.\n\nIf this whole situation is depressing and giving you thoughts of suicide and other signs of depression, STOP! Call the Crisis Hotline, tell them your situation, and they will help. No religion is worth your life, time, or mental health. If you have to be protected from your to defend yourself from your father's zealous wrath and abuse, TAKE IT! You're an adult. (It's not my intention to drive a wedge between your father-daughter relationship, and I don't mean to offend) If your father loves you as a daughter, and not like a religious \"purity trophy,\" then he has to learn to accept and respect your boundaries. He has to realize what's more important: Allah's happiness or his daughter's happiness?\n\nI hope this helps. Sorry, I got heated at the end."

His argument is that the the term all\u00e2h Is most likely derived from the aramaic word for God, al\u00e2h.\n\nWhile I agree that the the word allah was widely used to refer to god in arabic much before Mohammad was born, I have a slightly different theory. \n\nHere me out.\n\nIn pre-Islamic Arabia, one of the three chief dieties is Al-llat (also mentioned in the quran). She was honored daily by pouring libations at roof top altars and also placed right within the Ka'aba.\n\nLooking deeper, every muslim is taught that Mohammed's father was Abdulla. Which literally translates to 'Slave of allah'. All while we are constantly taught that Mohammed's father died a non-believer!\n\nNow, correct me if I'm wrong, but semantically speaking, the masculine form of the word Al-lath (\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0627\u062a) would be 'Al-lah' (\ufdf2\u200e).And it is a fact that Mohammed's family prayed to the gods in the Ka'aba. Including his own grandfather, who too had a peculiar name that designated him as the slave of another god that may have been placed inside.\n\nWhat Mohammed most likely did was to turn the diety his father worshipped, into the one true god. It was nothing special. He was much like every other religious person that ever lived!",

All of them pretty much support the view that the water has some useful (implies magical) properties and uses 'science' to prove it. But on a closer look, you'll notice that the research is backed by islamic universities & scholars who have quite the motive to skew the results in favor of islam.\n\nMy point is, there is a lot of false information related to islam that may look authentic, but need to be examined further if the information originates from people with ulterior motives.\n\nI'm all for scientific authenticity (especially since my deconversion, it's been my one grounding), but I also believe that 'Islamic science' is something we need to take with a grain of salt."

Semantically speaking.\n\nResponse: The term \"Allah\" in Arabic, used to denote the monotheistic concept of God in Islam, is inherently gender-neutral and does not have a masculine or feminine form. In Arabic, \"Allah\" is a unique term specifically referring to the one supreme God and does not conform to typical gender rules that apply to most nouns.\n\nPrompt 2: But if you were to consider allah as the masculine form, what would its feminine form be. In theory.\n\nResponse: In Arabic, the concept of God (Allah) is grammatically considered masculine, but this does not imply gender as it does in gendered nouns describing people or objects. If we were to theorize a feminine form of \"Allah\" purely linguistically and ignoring theological correctness, one might speculate a form like \"Allat\" (\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0627\u062a), which historically was the name of a pre-Islamic goddess.

They pumped the media full of this crap which in turn added more fuel to the already blazing racist fire.\u00a0\n5) The hypocrisy of how the Ukrainian immigrants were allowed in with open arms, the government even advocating for people to house them in their own homes and all the native English people had no issues, no qualms when normally you'd hear a ruckus. Even in our national TV a statement of \"this is not like the places before, these are people with blue eyes, blond hair like us\" (of course not exact words but from memory this is what was said in summary on national TV)\n6) How there have been tonnes of hate crime done to Muslims/ethnic minorities over the years but no one has rioted to this level. Even recently a woman and an 11yr old child both muslim were stabbed and a few years ago a woman and children died in a house fire. Statistically Muslims are the most demographic in the entire UK that get hate crimed\n7) How the idea of Muslim \"No go zones\" is bullshit lies since the areas are full of different ethnicities and anyone can visit these places and come out unscathed. I believe these people just are truly afraid of difference so when they go to these areas they get worked up all on their own and then run around acting like it's a no go zone. The actual \"no go zones\" are areas full of only white English people, (there are loads cause ethnic people are a minority. The way they talk makes it seem like we're half of the population or something, we're waaaaay lower than that) and if you are not English/Welsh/Irish/scottish you will experience racism/hate crime(i have visited a bunch and almost always there are people who will throw racist slurs or actually throw things at you, if you appear outwardly white you may be safe but, once they realise you are not, they will come for you as well). Of course we cannot blame all of these people for this, but majority of these areas house a large population of racists\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0...I wish I could speak but I am in fact a pussy \ud83d\ude02"

It\u2019s unacceptable for Muslim parents to try to get their daughter married before she even has a chance to go to study, work and live life as she wants to. Child marriages are unacceptable everywhere, inside and outside religion. \n\nStop defending Islam.\n\nDissent from Islam, because it allows the Prophet, Muslim parents and politicians in positions of power to legalize and normalize child marriages. And, change every system, whether in our home or in our countries, so that girls and children are safe and free to become adults capable of making their own decisions.\n\nHaram Doodles: https://www.instagram.com/p/C-i7s6rBBYr/",

I left Islam initially at 15 and most exmuslims from my country have the same experience, but that is because Arabic is our first language and there is no denying or altering to meanings of words as opposed to other languages where they gatekeep how you can understand the Quran fully, they will tell you translations are faulty and you have to be an expert in Arabic to understand and no non-Arab Muslim will question those arguments, you see them parroting them too.

        "text": "We recently had mass protests which turned into a revolution that threw the government out which was fascist and dictatorial in nature. However now, Islamist groups who did jack sh*t nothing throughout the protests, it was all done by the students and then slowly common people joined. But these so called 'huzurs' and all did nothing!\nNow they are taking advantage of the situation, already Hindu minorities have been under severe attacks, historic cultural symbols destroyed and overall it's just horrible.\nIdk wtf to do cause it seems like we could be heading into a 1979 Iran situation if things go on like this",
